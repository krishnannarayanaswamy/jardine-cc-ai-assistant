DBS Annual Report 2022

### Letter from the Chairman & CEO

Letter from the Chairman & CEO

DBS’ decade-long structural transformation continues to pay off. In a challenging year for the global economy, the bank turned in a solid performance.

The global economy faced multiple threats in 2022 – escalating geopolitical tensions, stubbornly high inflation, stalling growth and roiling financial markets. Supply chain disruptions – an issue amid the Covid pandemic of the last two years – were further exacerbated by the Ukraine war. This contributed to rising food, commodities and energy prices.

To fight decades-high inflation, the US Federal Reserve embarked on its most aggressive monetary tightening since the early 1980s. Altogether, it hiked rates seven times in 2022, raising short-term borrowing costs by 425 basis points to 4.25-4.50%, the highest level in 15 years. Many major central banks around the world similarly followed suit. These moves had a chilling effect on equity and bond markets.

DBS’ key markets Singapore and Hong Kong – being small, open economies – were impacted by slowing external demand. Singapore’s economy grew 3.6% in 2022, from 8.9% the year before. Hong Kong’s economy shrank by 3.5%. With its strict zero-Covid policy and property market slump, China remained in the doldrums.

Against this backdrop, we had yet another excellent year, with solid financial performance and continued delivery against key scorecard goals.

DBS also continued to cement its global standing, being named by Global Finance as "World's Best Bank". This made it the fifth consecutive year we had been lauded as the best in the world.

### Banner Year

For the year, DBS delivered record total income of SGD 16.5 billion. Net profit rose 20% to an all-time high of SGD 8.19 billion. Return on equity (ROE), at 15%, was not just a record, but also significantly higher when compared to previous highs around the 12-13% range.

DBS Annual Report 2022

Letter from the Chairman & CEO

In November, DBS opened a representative office in Bangladesh, bringing the bank’s international presence to 19 markets globally. Bangladesh is an attractive investment destination for companies in various sectors, such as power, energy, and transport and logistics. The establishment of DBS Dhaka will provide further impetus to the bank’s activities and enable greater market connectivity to DBS’ customers globally.

A new way of working

While DBS was ahead of the curve in transforming digitally, we recognise that digitalisation has become table stakes at most banks. However, there are three areas in which we have invested that continue to be differentiating.

The first is the industrialisation of artificial intelligence (AI)/ machine learning (ML) and data analytics usage across the bank. Our 260 use cases span customer-facing businesses such as consumer and SME banking, and support functions including Legal and Compliance, and Human Resources. For example, DBS sends 45 million hyper-personalised nudges each month to customers across the region with suggestions on how to make their money work harder. In the SME space, AI/ ML is used to provide businesses with early warning signals of potential credit stress. In 2022, the revenue uplift from our AI/ ML initiatives was about SGD 150 million, more than double that from the previous year.

The second is our ecosystem strategy, which has allowed us to scale up our business in the large Asian markets without high customer acquisition costs. DBS nearly doubled our ecosystem-led consumer finance lending in 2022. This was made possible through our partnerships with companies such as ByteDance, Ctrip, Home Credit and Kredivo in markets like China and Indonesia. In institutional banking, we also had good traction in onboarding large platform companies, and through our API suite, financing their extensive supply chains digitally.

The third is in the way we manage. While technology is an enabler, companies need to focus on the customer and speed to market to win. This requires a workforce that is agile, nimble, experimental, learning and willing to take risks. A big focus at DBS has been on enabling this internally. Previously, we had programmed change within the organisation such that our employees are trained to put the customer at the heart of all we do. In the past two years, we took this up a notch with the introduction of a new operating model “Managing through Journeys” (MtJs). With MtJ, we re-architected our most important

circumstances, the annualised dividend going over the years to transform the franchise.

We have benefited greatly from his wisdom forward will be SGD 1.68 per share. We have demonstrated over the past decade a track record of solid performance. In an increasingly fractured and unpredictable world, DBS will continue to be a different kind of bank – one that is trusted, purpose-driven and innovation-led so our customers can Live more, Bank less.

Veteran banker Ginger Cheng succeeded Neil Ge when he retired as Country CEO of DBS China. A Chinese citizen, Ginger has had a distinguished 20-year career in DBS spanning Hong Kong and China. Under her leadership, DBS’ IBG business in China had grown exponentially, with increased connectivity across the region.

Although we remain watchful, we take heart that our loan pipeline looks healthy. If animal spirits return to markets, we should also see some upside to fee income. Barring any unexpected shocks to the global economy, DBS’ ROE will comfortably be above 15%.

Going forward

More like a startup, less like a bank

Redesigning the way we work – Managing through Journeys

Some years back, to ensure we put the customer at the heart of the banking experience, we trained our people in customer journey thinking which encompassed elements like customer discovery and customer science. More recently, we took this up a notch and reorganized the way we work by Managing through Journeys (MtJs). MtJs enable the bank to function as a Horizontal Organization, with cross-functional teams across the bank collaborating to deliver value and enhanced customer experiences. These efforts have resulted in improved customer satisfaction in consumer and SME banking. Employee engagement has also risen, with DBS continuing to be Kincentric's Best Employer in Singapore and across Asia-Pacific.

Cultivating a future-ready workforce through training and development

Recognizing that our people are the driving force behind DBS’ transformation, we place significant focus on training and development.

Industrializing innovation

We seek to industrialize innovation throughout the organization. Through a proprietary Innovation Pyramid framework, we explore and exploit propositions that are new to bank, new to industry and new to the world. For instance, to be future-ready, we take bets on technologies that may mature only in a few years. High-profile new businesses such as DBS Digital Exchange and Partior are examples of such bets. We challenge business teams to conceptualize innovations, or “moonshot solutions”, that do not currently exist. Product teams are also tasked with elevating existing propositions to exceed customer expectations. Finally, to awaken the innovation DNA in all employees, we often run internal campaigns to crowdsource the best ideas from the bank.

Diversifying our tech workforce

We incorporated an innovation triangle – comprising three technological hubs – in Singapore, India, and China, to grow our own timber. Our technology hubs in Singapore sit under DBS Tech Singapore, while DBS Asia Hub 2 in Hyderabad has been rebranded as DBS Tech India. DBS Tech China will be launched in Guangzhou in mid-2024. These hubs will facilitate continual innovation, provide diversity, and hone our talents as they learn from each other.

Transforming our workspaces for optimal hybrid working

With hybrid work practices, DBS employees now spend three days in the office and two days working from home. To ensure that their time in the office is conducive to ideation, collaboration, and social connections, we continue to experiment with the design of spaces. We have done a series of experiments to drive creative thinking with flexible furniture, immersive lighting, and writable surfaces. The insights gathered from employee feedback are being used to design and curate productive workspaces for the future.

Helping customers navigate rising living costs

DBS was the first bank in Singapore to launch a fight inflation package in August, equipping those earning less than SGD 2,500 a month with a suite of solutions to stretch their dollar. We raised interest rates for our bank-and-earn solution Multiplier, making it easier for customers to earn more rebates on their everyday spend so they can get more cashback. We were also the only bank that offered a competitive Housing Development Board housing loan that is on par with HDB’s concessionary loan rate. More recently, we announced that we would subsidise five million hawker meals over a 12-month period until January 2024.

First bank in Southeast Asia to announce landmark set of decarbonisation commitments

Harnessing technology to unlock access to credit

First net-zero building by a bank

We opened Singapore's first net-zero building by a bank, DBS Newton Green. By retrofitting the 30-year-old building, we extended its lifespan. New technologies and creative design strategies were deployed to reduce energy consumption as much as possible while maximizing the building's capacity to generate its own renewable energy.

In our journey to be net-zero in our financed emissions by 2050, we were the first bank in Southeast Asia to announce a landmark set of decarbonisation commitments. These commitments are covered in our report "Our Path to Net Zero – Supporting Asia’s Transition to a Low-carbon Economy". The report details our decarbonisation and data coverage targets across nine sectors, including power, oil and gas, shipping, and real estate. With the range of sectors covered, DBS' commitment is among the most comprehensive and ambitious among global banks.

New café concept to entrench sustainability ethos among employees

We unveiled DBS Better World café, an employee café which aims to inspire Team DBS to do their part for a more sustainable world. The café incorporates a host of sustainability features in the fabric of its operations. These include a sustainable kitchen which uses locally-sourced ingredients, the hiring of disadvantaged individuals, and the deployment of food composting stations for employees to dispose of their food scraps.

DBS Foundation commits SGD 5.6 million to foster a more inclusive society

DBS Foundation committed SGD 3 million in grants to 15 social enterprises and eight SMEs, enabling them to create greater impact across social and environmental areas. The 23 awardees aim to impact two million lives, reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 319 tonnes, and reduce 132,000 tonnes of food waste.

The new Community Impact chapter of DBS Foundation aims to foster a more equitable and inclusive society. A total of SGD 5.6 million was committed towards 10 inaugural programs across DBS’ core markets of Singapore, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, and Taiwan. Signature programs include those which will equip beneficiaries with digital and financial literacy skills.

DBS continued to advance the sustainability agenda across our three pillars of responsible banking, responsible business practices, and impact beyond banking.

## Piyush Gupta shares his views on key issues driving the coming year's performance.

CEO reflections

and finance ministers meeting in recent months. Relations with Australia have similarly improved with the resumption of senior government exchanges as well as the easing of trade bans, including for coal, a major export. One consequence of these improvements will be the return of animal spirits to markets – well before their effects are felt in the real economy. Since the start of the year, financial assets led by equities and bonds globally have clawed back some of the losses incurred in 2022. I believe Asian markets, having underperformed US markets over the past two years, will lead the upturn. The macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop bodes well for our operating outlook in the coming year. A sustained level of high-interest rates is beneficial to our established Casa deposit franchise. Our latest net interest margin is now running at more than 2%, which is the highest in more than a decade. The higher rates, together with structural improvements from transformation initiatives, will enable us to sustain a ROE of more than 15% in the foreseeable future. At the same time, the restored confidence in financial markets will lead to a significant recovery in our wealth management fee income, which was the major drag on our performance in 2022. These factors will more than make up for any potential increase in credit costs. Although idiosyncratic risks cannot be ruled out, our ongoing stress tests indicate that asset quality will remain benign in the coming year.

## What is the outlook for the coming year?

Second, China’s reopening will provide a substantial boost to economic activity, particularly in Asia. We have seen how other countries’ reopening in the past year created a resurgence in travel and tourism, which are major economic sectors. China is bigger than other countries in the region. I expect consumption to substantially increase and energies unleashed across the region in the coming year now that the short-term pain from China’s reopening appears to have passed. Domestically, China has also corrected course on policies that clamped down on what it saw as excesses in key sectors. In the property sector, it has now provided liquidity support, including for the weakest companies. I do not foresee any property crisis there. In the technology sector, it has allowed major companies to release new games, sign up new customers and carry out new fundraising. Third, geopolitical tensions have started to ease, although spats could occur from time to time. The tone has softened since Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping met in Bali in November. China has subsequently appointed its ambassador to the US, who customarily spoke in more measured tones than his wolf warrior foreign ministry colleagues, as foreign minister. High-level exchanges with the US have resumed, with both sides’ foreign

ministers meeting in recent months. Relations with Australia have similarly improved with the resumption of senior government exchanges as well as the easing of trade bans, including for coal, a major export. One consequence of these improvements will be the return of animal spirits to markets – well before their effects are felt in the real economy. Since the start of the year, financial assets led by equities and bonds globally have clawed back some of the losses incurred in 2022. I believe Asian markets, having underperformed US markets over the past two years, will lead the upturn. The macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop bodes well for our operating outlook in the coming year. A sustained level of high-interest rates is beneficial to our established Casa deposit franchise. Our latest net interest margin is now running at more than 2%, which is the highest in more than a decade. The higher rates, together with structural improvements from transformation initiatives, will enable us to sustain a ROE of more than 15% in the foreseeable future. At the same time, the restored confidence in financial markets will lead to a significant recovery in our wealth management fee income, which was the major drag on our performance in 2022. These factors will more than make up for any potential increase in credit costs. Although idiosyncratic risks cannot be ruled out, our ongoing stress tests indicate that asset quality will remain benign in the coming year.

Can ROE be sustained above 15%?

Our ROE reached a new high of 17% in the second half of 2022. Higher interest rates were a big tailwind, but the record profitability was also driven by significant improvements we made to the franchise. If we look back to 2006-2007, when interest rates (and allowance charges) were at similar levels to the second half of 2022, our ROE was 12-13%. So there has been a four percentage point structural improvement in ROE. The key to the improvement has been our digital transformation. In 2017, we laid out our thesis that digitalisation would enable us to increase wallet share with lower marginal costs. In the consumer and SME businesses in Singapore and Hong Kong, where the benefits of digitalisation are most visible, we grew the proportion of digitally-engaged customers from 42% in 2017 to 60% in 2022. Over the past five years, these customers brought in more than twice the income on average than non-digital customers. They were also more cost efficient to serve. As a result, the ROE for the group. We have also improved credit processes through the use of data and artificial intelligence for underwriting, early warning and portfolio management, which we expect to drive lower cost of credit going forward. In our key growth markets, we are scaling up organically and through acquisitions. The announced increase in quarterly dividend payout to 42 cents per share and special dividend of 50 cents per share are part of our ongoing efforts to bring our CET1 ratio closer to the target and benefit ROE. To be sure, there will be a cyclical impact to ROE from changes in interest rates. If interest rates peak in the coming year, part of the ROE improvement so far will come off, but the structural gains will remain. We expect that as our digital transformation becomes more pervasive, an ROE of 15% is sustainable if interest rates do not return to the unusually low levels seen during most of the past decade.

As for artificial intelligence (AI)/ machine learning (ML), it is already a big part of our lives today. We use conversational AI through our interactions with Siri or Alexa, and AI-powered recommendation engines in our Spotify and Netflix selections. With ChatGPT taking the world by storm recently, 2023 is set to be a year of generative AI.

Blockchain/ distributed ledger technology allows us to reimagine workflows, such as those pertaining to clearing and settlements. This could dramatically change back-office operations by reducing costs and boosting overall efficiency and effectiveness. Tokenisation and digital monies will also be a part of our future.

At the same time, we continue to trial new initiatives. In 2022, DBS collaborated with the Monetary Authority of Singapore on two applications. The first involved using programmable money and retail central bank digital currencies to distribute purpose-bound vouchers. The second experimented with the trading of tokenised assets. Both pilots allowed us to test new capabilities including the use of smart contracts and the integration of traditional finance with decentralised finance.

In an ironic way, the collapse in valuations is also helpful to us as it reduces unsustainable market competition. With cheap money flooding markets in recent years, a lot of tech companies had been competing irrationally. The latest correction makes for a more rational marketplace. We may also find that as tech valuations become more reasonable, there may be opportunities to enhance our capabilities. The financial services industry is on the cusp of being reshaped by technology, and we must continue to be at the forefront of change for the benefit of customers and society-at-large.

DBS Annual Report 2022

### CFO statement

First, by cementing our status as customers’ primary bank, we were able to attract – and, crucially, retain – low-cost current and savings account (Casa) deposits. During the period of quantitative easing in 2020-21, our Casa deposits had risen by 60% or SGD 143 billion to SGD 381 billion, a significantly higher percentage growth than peers despite starting from a much larger base. While Casa deposits did flow out in the second half as expected as interest rates rose, half of the earlier inflows did stay with us, and we ended 2022 with Casa deposits of SGD 318 billion. The expanded Casa base enabled us to enjoy higher leverage to rising rates than in prior years, which contributed to the strong total income growth.

Second, several fee income activities were structurally larger. Credit and debit card billings rose by double-digit percentage terms for a second consecutive year, reaching new highs as our consumer payments platforms captured the post-pandemic spending recovery. Transaction service fees were propelled by higher domestic and cross-border payment volumes as well as new customer mandates. Compared to 2017, fee income from cards and from transaction services were around 50% bigger. Even wealth management fees, which declined 26% in 2022 due to financial market volatility, remained two-fifths larger than years ago.

Third, the Treasury Markets business delivered both strong growth and higher returns over the past five years. Income from trading and customer sales was two-fifths larger than in 2017. The digitalisation of our business also meant greater operating leverage as an incremental dollar of income could be generated with lower incremental unit cost. The full-year cost-income ratio improved three percentage points from a year ago to 43%. The second-half underlying ratio was 41%, in line with the longer-term target of around 40% that we had indicated several years ago.

We achieved another record performance, with ROE climbing to 15%. The results reflected the pervasive digital transformation we have been making for more than a decade.

### Record performance amidst macroeconomic uncertainty and financial market volatility

We achieved another record performance in 2022 as net profit rose 20% from a year ago to SGD 8.19 billion. Return on equity climbed to 15%, pulling away from previous highs clustered around 12-13%. The results were driven by a 16% increase in total income to SGD 16.5 billion, which passed the SGD 16 billion mark for the first time.

Underpinning the growth was a 30% increase in net interest income to SGD 10.9 billion, boosted by a higher net interest margin as interest rates rose, as well as loan growth. Non-interest income was 3% lower than the previous year’s record due to financial market volatility. Lower wealth management and investment banking fees as well as gains on investment securities were offset by growth in other fee income activities and net trading income.

The significant jump in our results reflected the pervasive digital transformation we have been making to our franchise for more than a decade. Average interest rates for the year were closer to the years before they were cut to near-zero over the previous two years, enabling the results of the transformation to become more apparent.

### Balance sheet remains strong

Asset quality was resilient throughout the year. Non-performing assets fell 12% to SGD 5.13 billion while the NPL ratio improved from 1.3% to 1.1%. New non-performing asset formation remained low and was offset by repayments and write-offs. Specific allowances amounted to eight basis points of loans or SGD 335 million, moderately below the 12 basis points a year ago.

General allowances of SGD 98 million were written back during the year due to transfers to NPA, upgrades, and repayments. Total allowance reserves amounted to SGD 6.24 billion, comprising general allowance reserves of SGD 3.74 billion and specific allowance reserves of SGD 2.51 billion. Allowance coverage was at 122% and at 215% when collateral was considered.

### Total shareholder returns

We delivered total shareholder returns of 8%, comprising share price gains of 4% and the dividend paid out during the calendar year of SGD 1.44 per share (comprising the final 2021 dividend and the dividends for the first three quarters of 2022, each of which was 36 cents per share).

### Increase in quarterly dividend and a special dividend

The Board proposed a final dividend of 42 cents per share, an increase of six cents from the previous payout, and a special dividend of 50 cents per share. The combined payout of 92 cents per share reflects our robust performance.

earnings profile and strong capital position. economic activity in the region. The IMF recently upgraded its global growth forecast for 2023 from 2.7% to 2.9%, although it would still be below the 3.4% in 2022. Our current stress tests indicate that asset quality will remain benign, with specific allowance charges likely to be below our through-the-cycle average of around 20 basis points.

|Cost-income ratio (%)|Reported vs Underlying cost-income ratio|
|---|---|
|Overall Consumer and SME (Singapore, Hong Kong)|49|
| |Digital (D) vs Traditional (T)|49|47|46|
|Underlying|45|45|44|45|44|

At time of writing, macroeconomic conditions are improving. Inflation, while still high, is moderating. China’s reopening will boost confidence and momentum in the coming year. We expect loans to grow by mid-single-digit percentage terms. Fee income should grow by double digits as the return of animal spirits to financial markets enables wealth management to recover from the declines in 2022, and as travel resumption boosts card spending further. Our full-year net interest margin will be significantly higher due to base effects as well as net benefits from further interest rate increases at least in the first few months of the year.

## Digitalisation

We continued to make significant progress in our digital transformation for the Consumer and SME businesses in Singapore and Hong Kong. Our drive for deeper digital engagement resulted in the number of digital customers more than doubling from 1.9 million in 2015 to 4.1 million in 2022. The proportion of digital customers rose by 27 percentage points over the seven years to 60%, delivering on our targets.

The share of income from digital customers rose 33 percentage points over the seven years to 82% in 2022. The digital segment continued to be more valuable due to stickier, deeper and broader customer relationships. With more diverse product holdings and number of transactions, digital customers consistently generated more than twice the income on average than traditional ones.

On an underlying basis, which normalizes for changes in net interest margin, the cost-income ratio was 44%, an improvement of one percentage point from the previous year. The underlying cost-income ratio improved five percentage points since 2015 even as we continued to invest to sustain our advantage over peers.

Our 2022 priorities

We use a balanced scorecard approach to measure how successfully we are serving stakeholders and executing our long-term strategy. Our scorecard, which is based on our strategy, is used to set objectives, drive behaviors, measure performance and determine the remuneration of our people, making this a living tool.

|Traditional KPIs|KPI/ Target|Outcome|
|---|---|---|
|Shareholders income growth|Total income rose 16% to SGD 16.5 billion, crossing the SGD 16 billion mark for the first time. A higher net interest margin and loan growth of 4% more than offset a decline in wealth management and investment banking fee income.| |
|Cost/Income (%)|The cost-income ratio improved by three percentage points to 43%. Expenses rose 10% to SGD 7.09 billion, led by higher staff costs.| |
|Speciﬁc allowances/ average loans (bp)|Asset quality was resilient. Non-performing assets (NPA) fell 12% as new NPA formation was low and more than offset by recoveries and write-offs. The NPL ratio improved from 1.3% to 1.1%. Specific allowances declined to eight basis points of average loans. General allowances of SGD 98 million were written back compared to a write-back of SGD 447 million a year ago.| |
|Return on equity (%)|ROE rose to a record 15.0%, above previous highs clustered around 12-13%, reflecting structural improvements in the franchise as average interest rates rose to more normalized levels.| |

## Asset quality was resilient despite the rising economic headwinds; nevertheless, we remained vigilant given the uncertain outlook in 2023.

### Top and emerging risks

The Board and senior management drive a robust process to identify and monitor our top and emerging risks.

As the global economy started to recover post pandemic, new challenges arose from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, escalating US-China tensions, and headwinds from elevated inflation and rising interest rates. We stayed vigilant and our portfolios remained resilient and asset quality stable.

In 2022, we continued to identify and monitor top and emerging risks across various areas, including:

- credit and portfolio management
- environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks
- market and liquidity risks
- new business risks
- technology risk
- financial crime risk
- data governance risk
- cyber security and data protection

### Credit risk and portfolio management

In 2022, the Russia-Ukraine conflict resulted in a slowdown of economic growth and increased inflationary pressures across the commodities complex, including oil, gas, and food. Portfolio reviews were conducted in light of these developments. Many sectors, especially for industries with inelastic demand, were able to pass on the higher costs to their customers. While there were no immediate concerns, DBS continued to monitor for potential downstream effects.

As inflationary pressures persisted, central banks began raising interest rates in response. We evaluated our portfolios taking into account the potential impacts of higher interest rates, slower economic growth, and depreciation of multiple currencies against the USD. While the SMEs were assessed to be the most vulnerable, our SME portfolio had been well-tested in previous years and was mostly on a secured basis. Notwithstanding these headwinds, DBS’ overall consumer credit quality remained stable. Residential mortgages, which were primarily in Singapore and Hong Kong, were mainly for owner-occupation and well-secured with low loan-to-value ratios. Unsecured consumer credit loans represented less than 2% of the bank’s total loan exposure.

### Environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks

We recognise that climate change has risk implications on our portfolio and lending to high-risk sectors will in turn have an impact on the pace of climate change. Enhancing ESG risk capabilities and in particular integrating climate risk into our risk identification, assessment and management therefore continues to be a top priority.

In 2022, we incorporated environmental risk into our Risk Appetite Statement, focusing on managing portfolio exposures to material climate transition and physical risks, and decarbonisation strategies. To further strengthen our ESG risk management, we developed quantitative methodologies to assess climate-related transition and physical risks for our Institutional Banking Group lending portfolio, and a counterparty ESG risk scoring mechanism which forms part of our credit risk management framework.

### Market and liquidity risks amidst market volatility

2022 was a year of heightened macroeconomic uncertainty and volatility. We actively adjusted our market risk exposures and rebalanced hedges during the year. Regular and adhoc stress tests were conducted to evaluate the potential implications to our portfolios in the face of elevated interest rates.

### New business risks

In January 2022, DBS announced the acquisition of Citi's consumer banking business in Taiwan. The integration process is in progress and is expected to be completed in 2023. We do not anticipate any significant impact on the consumer banking portfolio with the acquisition.

The integration of Lakshmi Vilas Bank has proceeded as expected. To effectively manage the risks associated with the new products and expanded network, we have deepened the expertise of our risk management team. We have also strengthened processes for existing products to ensure effective management over a larger footprint. The final stage of system integration into DBS India Limited was successfully completed in December 2022.

### Technology risk

Our technology risk management framework is based on a three-pronged approach of risk evaluation, response and governance. As part of risk evaluation, we identify and analyze the risks, define the risk metrics and monitor the issues, risk events and key risk indicators. Responses are made through risk-based decisions taking into account risk control and mitigation measures. Updates on our technology risk profiles are provided regularly to the various risk committees.

### Financial crime risk

As part of our ongoing efforts to combat financial crime, we have enhanced our risk mitigation program by utilizing technology and data analytics. We implemented a variety of AI/ML tools to enhance our surveillance capabilities at the transaction, customer, and country level. Our customer due diligence process was further refined with dynamic analytical reviews based on changes in static data or transactional behavior. We continued to place strong emphasis on public-private sector collaboration, actively participating in initiatives between financial institutions and law enforcement agencies, including the planned Project COSMIC (Collaborative Sharing of Money Laundering / Terrorism Financing Information & Cases) to be launched in Singapore.

### Data governance risk

We recognize that responsible practices around data governance are key for customer and stakeholder trust. Our data governance risk framework was developed along the following three prisms: (i) a baseline prism encompassing data security, data quality, and legal and regulatory compliance, (ii) an ethical prism – PURE (Purposeful, Unsurprising, Respectful and Explainable) – for the responsible use of data, and (iii) a model governance prism, covering regulated and AI models and their performance over time.

### Cyber security and data protection

We faced a deteriorating cyber threat environment as geopolitical tensions escalated and cyber criminals and threat actors sought to target our customers and staff. To combat these threats, we strengthened our control environment to protect our people, information, network, equipment and applications. We stepped up security awareness campaigns and alerted our customers to emerging frauds and scams through timely security advisories. Despite these threats, we made significant progress in addressing phishing scams in partnership with the regulators and authorities. Amid rising geopolitical tensions, we will remain vigilant and continue to enhance our control environment to stay ahead of the cyber threat curve.

# Introduction

Amid growing geopolitical uncertainty and an increasingly challenging business climate, DBS continued focusing on innovation to retain our competitive advantage. We adopted a barbell strategy that spurs innovation and experimentation with new technologies on one end, while keeping a vigilant eye on resilience and risks on the other.

## Driving innovation

Digitalisation has become table stakes for financial institutions, and many digital initiatives we embarked on over the past few years are now par for the course. To retain our lead and widen the gap between us and our competitors, we must continue creating differentiated technology innovations.

Our artificial intelligence (AI)/ machine learning (ML) business use cases increased by seven times to 260, enabling us to achieve about SGD 150 million in revenue in 2022. We aspire to achieve SGD 1 billion in the next five years.

## CIO statement

Our investment in our people and building a strong technological foundation have enabled us to be a different kind of bank. Our rallying call is to optimize our technology stack, scale outputs, and provide all-rounded customer and employee experiences that transform business outcomes.

Our multi-year application transformation implemented initiatives to foster a culture of innovation, growth, and customer centricity through life-long learning. Tech Academy further builds technical expertise through in-house curriculums developed by our subject matter experts.

Our digital transformation investments over the last decade have equipped us well for the journey ahead. We are strongly positioned with multiple world-class digital platforms, a capacity for continuous innovation, and a future-ready workforce that entrenches us as a different kind of bank.

Consumer Banking:

Leveraging AL/ ML and ecosystem partnerships to deepen engagement

Strong interest income growth cushions macro impact

2022 overview

Amid a volatile macro environment, Consumer Banking/ Wealth Management achieved a robust set of results and maintained a healthy balance sheet. We benefited from the tailwinds that came through higher interest rates, although growth was moderated by market uncertainty which impacted wealth management fee activities. Business momentum was sustained by record-high net new money flows into the region and the expansion of our consumer finance business. We further bolstered our efforts to use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) capabilities to deepen customer engagement, which also yielded good results. We will continue to expand our business footprint and advance our digital solutions to deliver seamless and differentiated customer experiences.

Digitalisation is now the baseline. The real test for the bank is how we leverage our scale, assets, digital capabilities and people to create innovative solutions that help our customers grow and protect their wealth.

Helping our customers live sustainably and fight inflation

2023 FOCUS AREAS

- Continue to bolster our 'phygital' strategy by expanding AI/ ML capabilities and transforming our physical touchpoints to better engage with customers
- Sustain the wealth business growth momentum by capturing inflows and delivering sustainable fee income stream from the region, including the GBA
- Accelerate our consumer finance business overseas by onboarding new ecosystem partners
- Further entrench our MtJs transformation to empower more people to embrace agile journey thinking and deliver better customer outcomes

POSB: Highlights in 2022
41

For children

Today, some 70,000 students in more than 100 schools are using POSB Smart Buddy smartwatches and cards for digital payments. The programme also supports needy students under the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme. To date, about 60 Smart Buddy schools are administering meal subsidies to some 5,000 students via POSB Smart Buddy.

POSB Passion Run for Kids

Singapore’s largest charity kids run organised a hybrid race, which included a virtual race and onsite sustainability-themed activities. Our beach clean-up and tree planting activity entered the Singapore Book of Records as the Largest Mass Plogging event and raised over SGD 930,000.

To date, we have raised SGD 11.6 million, with more than 790,000 children benefiting from 198 programmes. One of the marquee programmes included a “EcoHeroes@Home” programme to encourage children and their families to reduce energy consumption at home.

POSB Smart Buddy Programme

We continued to expand the world’s first integrated in-school savings and payments programme to more schools. The POSB Smart Buddy programme, which was launched in 2017, creates a contactless payments ecosystem within the school environment to help cultivate sensible savings and spending habits among young students in an interactive, engaging manner. These students are then better equipped to achieve financial wellness when they transition to the next stage of their lives.

We were the first bank to sign a Memorandum of Understanding with the Ministry of Education (MOE) to install a digital payment infrastructure in more than 330 primary, secondary schools, junior colleges/ Millennia Institute and special education (SPED) schools within three years. Under the partnership, we will also provide up to 400,000 students with smartwatches and cards for payments.

For seniors

The DBS Foundation contributed SGD 1 million, which includes the government’s dollar-for-dollar matching, to the Digital for Life movement and stepped up our volunteer participation to bolster digital inclusion efforts in Singapore. The broad-based support, through our strategic collaboration with IMDA, includes jointly launching community programmes and organizing workshops to raise digital and financial literacy. Through our People of Purpose movement, our employees in Singapore will run the workshops.

We aim to reach 100,000 Singaporeans and residents across various community segments, such as youths, persons with disabilities, seniors and hawkers over the next two years.

Neighbours first, bankers second

POSB digital literacy workshops

As Singapore’s oldest and most loved bank, POSB takes pride in serving generations of Singaporeans from all walks of life since our founding in 1877. While our neighborhoods and lifestyles have changed with the times, we stayed true to our mission of being the “People’s Bank” that provides pioneering solutions that cater to the evolving needs of all segments of the population. They include children, young adults, families, seniors and the community at large. By widening our reach in the community through various initiatives, we remain committed to bringing value to Singaporeans.

We stepped up our digital literacy programmes for seniors, which included a newly created anti-scam and cybersecurity workshop that was co-developed with the Singapore Police Force, National Crime Prevention Council and Cyber Security Agency of Singapore. In 2022, we organized more than 130 virtual and physical workshops, engaging some 5,300 seniors.

Besides deepening collaborations with agencies such as the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), the Council for Third Age and PA, we worked with new partners such as TOUCH Community Services to empower more seniors. We were a key partner of IMDA's inaugural Digital for Life Festival, which involved more than 65,000 participants and visitors.

DBS Annual Report 2022

### Corporate governance

Technology, Risks and Resiliency

Improvement Plan

The Board had an in-depth discussion on the independent technology review remediation conducted by KPMG and our Resiliency Improvement Plan updates. In particular, the KPMG independent technology review provided important observations and recommended opportunities for improvement in key areas surrounding DBS’ digital banking processes. The updates on our Resiliency Improvement Plan are organised into several pillars to address key technology risks and included uplifting of certain critical applications and runtimes, focusing on technology architecture, third party software and services and system recovery. It also enhances the governance and structure for incident and crisis management. In addition, the Board was updated on the establishment of a resiliency project steering committee, tasked with the objectives of heightening resiliency, reducing incident occurrence, mitigating incident impact and improving recovery speed.

### Sustainability

Environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues were a significant focus area for the Board during 2022. The Board engaged with external subject matter experts and leading business leaders on various matters, including the impact of the current energy crisis, views of the path to Net Zero by 2050 and the future of energy, key learnings about the energy situation over the last 20-30 years, industry best practices on sustainability matters where there is currently no consensus on the data capture or metrics to be used, and the role of intermediaries such as banks in helping companies manage trade-offs and facilitating a just transition.

### People and Culture

People and culture were another area of focus for the Board in 2022. The CEO updated the Board on the 2022 employee survey, “MyVoice” and noted that the Group saw an improvement in the MyVoice engagement score, with improvements across most dimensions (including enabling productivity, wellbeing and hybrid working). Most of our core markets recorded an increase in employee engagement and outperformed the respective country financial services industry scores. The Board discussed people and leadership matters, including the need to focus on employee and to provide clear career paths for employees and to drive gender, inter-generational and foreign talent diversity and inclusion.

### Board Renewal

Board renewal is a key focus for us. In 2022, the Nominating Committee (NC) continued the search for potential candidates who could be lined up for appointment as Directors of DBS Group Holdings Ltd (DBSH) and DBS Bank Ltd (DBS Bank). New Directors will be introduced gradually so that the Board and Board committees have a smooth transition period. Diversity in, inter alia, gender and skillsets were one of the key considerations in the board renewal process to ensure that the Board is appropriately balanced to support the long-term success of DBS and the skillsets of the retiring Directors are replaced and/or the collective skillsets of the Directors are supplemented, and different perspectives are brought to the Board.

### CEO Updates to the Board

In 2022, the CEO updated the Board on, inter alia, the entrenchment of our Singapore market leadership, the progress and impact of our digitalisation efforts in Singapore, DBIL’s performance and 2023 outlook, the acquisition of Citi's Taiwan consumer banking business, the employee engagement survey results and focus areas, the continuation of our transformation journey, updates on the Group’s business strategy in the Greater Bay Area, India and Indonesia, various new business initiatives, and 2023 key priorities.

### Selection criteria and nomination process

Before a new Director is appointed, suitable candidates are identified from various sources. Thereafter, the NC conducts an assessment to review the candidate (including qualifications, attributes, capabilities, skills, age, past experience) to determine whether the candidate is fit and proper in accordance with the guidelines issued by the MAS; and ascertain whether the candidate is independent from DBSH’s substantial shareholder and/or from management and business relationships with DBS.

### Highlights of NC’s activities in 2022

Board renewal process

Tham Sai Choy, NC Chairman

The NC reviews and determines annually whether each Director is independent in accordance with the stringent standards required of financial institutions prescribed under the Regulations. Under the Regulations, an “independent director” is defined to mean a Director who is independent from any management and business relationship with DBS; independent from any substantial shareholder of DBS; and has not served on the Board of DBS for a continuous period of nine years or longer.

### Induction and Training for Directors

The NC oversees the onboarding of new Directors. All new Directors go through our induction programme, which covers the duties and obligations of a Director and the responsibilities of and work carried out by the Board committees. We provide a Director’s pack, which acts as an aide memoire for the information covered by the induction programme.

### Annual review of Directors’ independence

The NC makes an assessment at least once a year to determine whether the Board and Board committees are performing effectively and identifies steps for improvement. The NC believes that it is important to obtain an independent perspective on the Board’s performance periodically, and to gain insights on the Board’s performance against peer boards and best practices.

### Board performance and evaluation

The NC considered the results and key action items from the 2021 Board evaluation and decided to use substantially the same evaluation questionnaire for 2021 for benchmarking purposes. The questionnaire included questions on Board composition, Board information, Board processes/culture, Board accountability, Capital/risk Management, Standards of Conduct, Board relationships and effectiveness of Board committees. Each Director was asked to complete the questionnaire and submit it directly to the Group Secretary who collated the responses and produced a summary report for the NC.

### Board performance and evaluation

In addition to the annual Board evaluation exercise, the NC also conducts an annual review of each Director to determine whether each Director remains qualified for office. In making its determination, the NC will take into account the Director’s age, track record, experience, skills and capabilities; whether each Director is able to and has been adequately carrying out his/her duties as a Director, including the contributions and performance of each Director; and whether each Director has committed sufficient time to his/her duties as a director of DBS. The Board is satisfied that each Director has diligently discharged his or her duties as a Director of DBS and has contributed meaningfully to DBS.

DBS Annual Report 2022

### Corporate governance

Directors’ time commitment

The meeting attendance records of all Directors as well as a list of their directorships of listed companies and their principal commitments are fully disclosed in our Annual Report. The NC assesses each Director’s ability to commit time to DBS’ affairs in accordance with internal guidelines which take into account the number of other board and committee memberships a Director holds, as well as the size and complexity of the companies in which he/she is a board member. Additionally, each Director is required to complete an annual self-assessment of his/her time commitments.

Re-election of Directors

Under the Constitution of DBSH, one-third of Directors who are longest-serving since their last re-election are required to retire from office and, if eligible, stand for re-election at each AGM. Based on this rotation process, each Director is required to submit himself or herself for re-election by shareholders at least once every three years. In addition, new Directors (who are appointed in between AGMs) are required under DBSH’s Constitution to stand for re-election at the first AGM after their appointment. The NC reviews and recommends to the Board the rotation and re-election of Directors at the AGM.

Directors’ tenure

The NC members believe that it is in the interests of DBS for the Board to be comprised of some Directors with long tenure who have a deep understanding of the banking industry, as well as Directors with shorter tenures who can bring fresh ideas and perspectives. There are currently three Directors who have served for more than 11 years, and this is balanced by the progressive refreshing of the Board where six long-serving Directors have stepped down and seven new Directors have been appointed since November 2017. In addition, one of the long-serving Director (Mr Ho Tian Yee) will step down after the conclusion of the 2023 AGM.

Directors’ time commitment

|Director|Number of other board and committee memberships|Principal commitments|
|---|---|---|
|Mr. Peter Seah|3|ABC Company, XYZ Committee|
|Ms. Punita Lal|2|DEF Company|
|Mr. Anthony Lim|1|GHI Committee|

### Highlights of EXCO’s activities in 2022

- The EXCO assists the Board to enhance the business strategies and strengthen core competencies of DBS.
- In addition to its quarterly review of weak credit cases, matters discussed and/or endorsed at the EXCO meetings in 2022 included various acquisition and investment/divestment opportunities.
- The EXCO meets frequently (12 meetings in 2022) and is able to offer greater responsiveness in the decision-making process of DBS.

### Highlights of AC’s activities in 2022

Oversight of financial reporting and disclosure matters

In response to the risk-based approach to quarterly reporting that was adopted by the Singapore Exchange Regulation (SGX RegCo) from 7 February 2020, the Group transitioned to a semi-annual reporting regime that is complemented by trading updates between the half-yearly financial reports. The AC reviewed the Group’s trading updates and half-yearly financial statements, and recommended these to the Board for approval.

The AC reviewed the Group’s audited consolidated financial statements for FY2022 and discussed with management and the external auditor the significant matters which involved management judgement.

The AC is of the view that the Group’s consolidated financial statements for FY2022 are fairly presented in conformity with the relevant SFRS(I) in all material aspects. The Board has been notified that the Group’s external auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC), has read and considered the financial or non-financial information (i.e. other than the financial statements and auditor’s report thereon) in the annual report, whether financial or non-financial, in accordance with the Singapore Standard on Auditing 720.

For further information on these significant matters, please refer to the table on page 54.

## Compensation and Management Development Committee (CMDC)

"In 2022, the CMDC continued to focus on reviewing the strength of human capital in DBS that is required to drive our business outcomes.b This included a rigorous assessment of our succession plans for senior leadership roles and an evaluation of how our High Potentials (HIPOs) have been identified, developed, compensated and progressed in their career with the Bank. 21.0% of our HIPOs took on a new role while 36.4% have an enlarged role."b

Given DBS’ heavy investment in the development of our people, the CMDC ensured that robust plans have been put in place to drive leadership development at all levels, and also continuous upskilling and reskilling of our people so that they remain future-ready. In 2022, 99.6% of our employees have undergone training, with 8,339 employees in the process of going through upskilling and reskilling.

Effective controls

Group Approving Authority

The Group Approving Authority (GAA) is an integral part of our corporate governance framework and was updated in August 2022. The Board’s responsibilities are well defined in the GAA. The Board is the decision-making body for matters with significant impact to DBS as a whole; these include matters with strategic, financial or reputational implications or consequences. The specific matters that require board approval under the GAA include:

- Group’s annual and interim financial statements;
- Investments and divestments exceeding certain material limits;
- Group’s annual budget;
- Capital expenditures and expenses exceeding certain material limits;
- Capital-related matters including capital adequacy objectives, capital structure, capital issuance and redemption;
- Dividend policy; and
- Risk strategy and risk appetite statement.

Scope of delegation of authority in the GAA

The GAA ensures that appropriate controls and decision-making are consistently applied throughout DBS. Under the GAA, the Board has delegated to the CEO the responsibility to ensure that the Group’s businesses and operations are operated in accordance with Board-approved strategies and standards, which include responsibilities for the internal control framework within DBS. On matters where authority has been delegated to him, the CEO may further delegate his responsibilities and authorities to any GMC member or members and may empower them to, in turn, delegate their responsibilities and authorities to other executives and committees of the Group.

Oversight of sustainability reporting and climate-related disclosure matters

In response to tracking our disclosures following our public commitment to join the Net Zero Banking Alliance, the BSC reviewed and approved the publication of a set of targets for our Scope 3 financed emissions that will guide us on strategically channeling financing away from high-emitting activities towards low-carbon alternatives.

Oversight of other emerging sustainability issues

The BSC also discussed on key developments, such as climate finance and adaptation, addressed at the 27th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP27), and the corresponding risks, opportunities, and impacts to the bank.

DBS Annual Report 2022

### Corporate governance

DBS has put in place a personal investment policy which prohibits employees with access to price-sensitive information in the course of their duties from trading in securities in which they possess such price-sensitive information. Such employees are also required to seek pre-clearance before making any personal trades in securities, and may only trade through the Group’s stockbroking subsidiaries and bank channels for securities listed in Singapore and Hong Kong. The personal investment policy discourages employees from engaging in short-term speculative trading.

### Material contracts

Save for the transactions disclosed in the table on page 60 and via SGXNET, there were no material contracts involving the interest of any Director or controlling shareholder of DBS entered into by DBS or any of its subsidiary companies, which are either still subsisting at the end of the financial year, or if not then subsisting, entered into since the end of the previous financial year.

### Assessing the effectiveness of internal controls

DBS has a risk management process that requires all units to perform a half-yearly risk and control self-assessment (RCSA) to assess the effectiveness of their internal controls. In addition, all units of the Group are required to submit quarterly attestations on their controls relating to the financial reporting process, and annual attestations on their compliance with the overall internal controls framework.

### Related Party Transactions and Interested Person Transactions

DBS has embedded procedures to comply with regulations governing related party transactions and interested party transactions. For related party transactions, DBS is required to comply with regulations prescribed by the MAS which set out the definition, scope and general principles governing such transactions, along with the responsibilities of banks to maintain oversight and control to mitigate the risk of abuse arising from conflicts of interest.

## Summary of current total compensation elements

The table below provides a description of total compensation elements, their purpose and implementation:

|Elements|Purpose|Details|
|---|---|---|
|Salary|Attract and retain talent by ensuring our fixed pay is competitive vis-à-vis comparable institutions|- Set at an appropriate level, taking into account market dynamics as well as the skills, experience, responsibilities, competencies and performance of the employee
- Enable employees to share in DBS’ performance
- Help in talent retention
|
|Cash bonus and deferred awards|Provide a portion of total compensation that is performance-linked|- Based on DBS, business or support unit, and individual performance
- Measured against a balanced scorecard which is agreed to at the start of the year
- A Group-wide deferral approach is applicable for all employees
|

## Determination of variable pay pool

The variable pay pool is derived from a combination of a bottom-up and top-down approach. It is underpinned by our aim to drive a pay-for-performance culture which is aligned to our risk framework.

### Process

Determining total variable pay pool

- A function of our overall balanced scorecard and benchmarked against the market
- Variable pay pool calibrated against risk adjustment and appropriate distribution of surplus earnings

Allocating pool to business units

- Pool allocation based on the relative performance of each unit against their balanced scorecard
- Inputs from control functions and consultation with Country Heads

Determining individual award

- Unit heads cascade their allocated pool to their teams and individuals
- Individual variable pay determined based on performance against goals and DBS PRIDE! values
- Employees with disciplinary warning may have their variable pay impacted

### Summary of 2022 remuneration outcomes

Our remuneration is linked to how we perform against our balanced scorecard which is aligned to long-term value creation for our stakeholders in a sustainable way. As our scores improved in the current financial year, our variable pay pool was better than the previous year.

The Compensation and Management Development committee evaluated and approved the variable pay pool which was subsequently endorsed by the Board of Directors.

In 2022, an external compensation consultant, McLagan, was engaged to provide an independent review of the Group’s compensation system and processes to ensure compliance with the FSB Principles for Sound Compensation Practices.

Senior management and material risk personnel have a substantial portion of remuneration as variable, subject to deferral to align with the time horizon of risks.

Read more about our stakeholder engagement on pages 80 and 81.

In 2022, we reviewed the findings of our last formal materiality assessment, which had been completed in the prior year. We also conducted a new analysis, which included desktop research of external trends, data analysis, and regular dialogues with our key stakeholders through various platforms and feedback channels to gain new insights and identify matters of key relevance to them.

It was concluded that last year’s outcome of the materiality assessment remained broadly in line. However, based on various engagements with our key stakeholder groups, we included “Human Rights” as a new material matter to better reflect how we uphold the responsibility to respecting human rights in everything we do. Additionally, we made a clearer distinction across “Building a Great Corporate Culture”, “Developing Our People” and “Driving Diversity, Equity and Inclusion”, as we view these matters to be of increasing importance. Our refined approach responds to the changing needs of our stakeholders and the increasing importance of responsible business practices.

|Macroeconomic, geopolitical and tail risks|High inflationary environment driven by energy and food prices, and supply chain disruptions have driven central banks to hike interest rates at an unprecedented pace, creating headwinds to economic growth. In addition, difficult geopolitical situation with tensions remaining elevated between the superpowers.|Higher interest rates will benefit banks at an early stage of the economic cycle, especially as long as credit costs and losses remain under control. Investments and consumption have picked up in Asia after two years of economic uncertainty due to the pandemic, especially due to the reopening of China via trade and tourism.|Our broad-based franchise and nimble execution enabled us to capture regional opportunities despite the macroeconomic uncertainty and financial market volatility. Our income was also boosted by a higher net interest margin. We took another step in scaling up our presence in growth markets with our acquisition of the Citi consumer banking business in Taiwan.|
|Digital transformation|A new wave of operational and systemic risks may be created as digital banking transformation programmes become more deeply embedded in the banking industry, all the while as customers and industry players become increasingly digitally savvy. The challenges are compounded against a backdrop of higher workforce attrition and labour shortages in the tech space.|Banks that are able to consistently deliver differentiated technological innovations with robust, reliable and resilient systems will provide a more seamless and secure user experience and gain customer confidence and a competitive advantage.|We are developing and scaling robust systems through Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). We also strengthened our cybersecurity capabilities to address a larger attack surface and potential gaps in work processes as companies scale their remote working arrangements and support hybrid working. We also made efforts to diversify and upskill our tech workforce while maintaining continuity within technology teams.|
|Mastering data and artificial intelligence (AI)|As banks rise to the challenge of meeting consumer demand for banking experiences that are intuitive, they will need to re-architect legacy technology and their data stack. The ethics of using AI algorithms is also coming under strict scrutiny, especially in the areas of accountability, transparency, and data bias.|Unlocking the value of data in our business operating model will help drive greater economic value through delivering tailored customer experiences and employee journeys, developing greater operational efficiencies and lowering costs through higher automation, accelerating deployments by improving operations and decision-making, and adopting emerging technologies to create new products/services through rapid innovations.|As an AI-fuelled bank, we have made AI central to our core strategy, and incorporated AI technologies into our management and operation processes. To build trust through fair, ethical and responsible use of data and AI, we continually enhance our DBS PURE (Purposeful, Unsurprising, Respectful, Explainable) framework and AI governance processes and controls. Industrialising AI throughout the bank has enabled us to power differentiated customer experiences and achieve hyper-personalised services for customers.|
|Data governance|Rapid digitisation has intensified data collection and analytics, which are used to drive new business initiatives. This has led to greater demands for enhanced standards of data protection and privacy. A weak data governance framework for data capturing, data quality, and data use will increase the risk of non-compliance, financial losses, regulatory fines, and reputational damage.|Strong data governance programmes will deliver faster and sharper insights for decision-making, and enhance risk and fraud management to deliver positive business outcomes as we scale the use of data and analytics across the bank. As we place privacy at the heart of our products and services design, we uphold the trust of our customers and deepen our relationship with them.| |
|Human rights|Insufficient integration of human rights principles and human rights due diligence in our business operations may expose us to unintended and unforeseen legal, financial, and reputational risks.|Respecting human rights in everything we do reaffirms the critical role we play to positively contribute to society as a bank and as an employer. By integrating human rights related policies and procedures in our lending and business operations, we promote economic inclusion and empower marginalised communities, allowing us to tap into new markets and create new business opportunities.| |
|Building a great corporate culture|The pandemic has permanently changed the way we live, learn and work and raised awareness of the importance of mental well-being for our people.|Redesigning the workplace and building the right behaviours empower employees to thrive and drive more impactful customer outcomes. A strong corporate culture which is open, collaborative, and with a focus on employees’ holistic wellbeing will help organisations attract and retain the best talent and drive business performance.| |
|Driving diversity, equity & inclusion (DEI)|Being an organisation that operates in 19 different markets, failure to embrace diversity, equity and inclusion will run us the risk of not being effective in the communities that we operate in. It also affects our global brand and ability to retain diverse talent to drive our businesses.|Fostering an inclusive culture attracts and retains the best talent for our workforce.

Additionally, with an extensive suite of application programming interfaces (APIs), DBS is well positioned to embed our services on our partners' platforms to acquire and distribute at scale. We are scaling existing and building new ecosystem partnerships to extend our reach, create a differentiated customer experience and avail our services to customers in the right context.|
|Responsible financing|Insufficient integration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations into our business operations would expose the bank to various emerging risks such as climate-related physical and transition risks.|The investment needs to transition our economies to a net-zero future are very significant. As estimated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2021, this investment would amount to an additional USD 3.5 trillion annually. This provides an opportunity to support clients with advisory services and financing solutions. We committed to aligning our lending and financing activities with net-zero by 2050. Additionally, we established science-informed decarbonisation strategies and set 2030 decarbonisation targets for a large number of sectors. To date, this is among the most comprehensive and ambitious sets of decarbonisation targets among banks globally.

## Risk management

The Board oversees DBS’ affairs and provides sound leadership for the CEO and management. Authorised by the Board, various Board committees oversee specific responsibilities based on clearly defined terms of reference.

Under our risk management approach, the Board, through the Board Risk Management Committee (BRMC), sets our Risk Appetite, oversees the establishment of enterprise-wide risk management policies and processes, and establishes risk appetite limits to guide DBS’ risk-taking.

The BRMC also oversees the identification, monitoring, management and reporting of credit, market, liquidity, operational and reputational risks.

To facilitate the BRMC’s risk oversight, the following risk management committees have been established.

Risk management committees
Risk Executive Committee (Risk EXCO)
Group Credit Risk Committee (GCRC)
Group Credit Risk Models Committee (GCRMC)
Group Market and Liquidity Risk Committee (GMLRC)
Group Operational Risk Committee (GORC)
Group Scenario and Stress Testing Committee (GSSTC)

Each of the committees reports to the Risk EXCO, and serves as an executive forum to discuss and implement DBS’ risk management.

Key responsibilities:

- Assess and approve risk-taking activities
- Oversee DBS’ risk management infrastructure, which includes frameworks, decision criteria, authorities, people, policies, standards, processes, information and systems
- Approve risk policies such as model governance standards, stress testing scenarios, and the evaluation and endorsement of risk models
- Assess and monitor specific credit concentration
- Recommend stress-testing scenarios (including macroeconomic variable projections) and review the results

The members in these committees comprise representatives from the Risk Management Group (RMG) as well as key business and support units.

The PAC provides group-wide oversight and direction for the approval of new product and outsourcing initiatives. It evaluates new product and outsourcing initiatives to ensure that they are in line with the DBS’ strategy and risk appetite.

## Risk Appetite

DBS’ Risk Appetite is set by the Board and governed by the Risk Appetite Policy, which articulates the risks that we are willing to accept. It also serves to reinforce our risk culture by setting a clear message from the ‘tone from the top’. A strong organizational risk culture, complemented with a balanced incentive framework (refer to “Remuneration Report” section on page 63), helps to further embed our Risk Appetite.

### Risk thresholds and economic capital usage

Our Risk Appetite takes into account a spectrum of risk types and is implemented using thresholds, policies, processes and controls. Setting thresholds is essential in making DBS’ Risk Appetite an intrinsic part of our businesses as they help to keep all our risks within acceptable levels. Portfolio risk limits for the quantifiable risk types are established top down, and these are implemented using frameworks. As for the non-quantifiable risk types, these are managed using qualitative principles.

## A Different Kind of Bank

DBS Annual Report 2022

### Risk management

To ensure that the thresholds pertaining to our Risk Appetite are completely risk sensitive, we adopted both economic capital (EC) and regulatory capital (RC) as our risk metrics. Additionally, both EC and RC are assessed as part of our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP).

Our capital allocation structure monitors credit, market and operational risks by assessing regulatory capital utilisation at the business unit level.

The diagram below shows how they are managed along the various dimensions. A buffer is also maintained for other risks, such as country, reputational, model risks, etc.

Operational Risk
Processes, systems and reports

DBS' approach to credit risk management comprises the following building blocks:

- Retail exposures are assessed using credit score models, credit bureau records as well as internally and externally available customer behavior records supplemented by our Risk Acceptance Criteria (RAC).
- Environmental, social and governance risks

Refer to Section 5.3 on page 88 to read more about our internal credit risk models.

DBS considers ESG risks as critical in our pursuit of business strategies. The Board approves DBS’ overall and specific risk governance frameworks and oversees an independent Group-wide risk management system.

Refer more about "Responsible Financing" in the Sustainability Report.

### Risk Limits, Triggers and Controls

Other quantitative or qualitative controls are used to manage the other risks at granular levels. The following chart provides a broad overview of how our Risk Appetite permeates throughout DBS. Refer to Sections 5 through 9 for more information about each risk type.

### Credit Risk

The most significant measurable risk DBS faces - credit risk - arises from our daily activities in our various businesses. These activities include lending to retail, corporate and institutional customers.

The operational standards and guides are established to provide greater details on the implementation of the credit principles within the Group Core Credit Risk Policies (CCRPs) and are adapted to reflect different credit environments and portfolio risk profiles.

The Group Core Credit Risk Policies (CCRPs) are approved by the Group Chief Credit Officer.

Credit risk is managed by thoroughly understanding our wholesale customers - the businesses they are in, as well as the economies in which they operate. It is also managed through statistical models and data analytics for retail customers.

Issuer default risk that may also arise from derivatives, notes and securities are generally measured based on jump-to-default events in a specific country (or a group of countries).

### Stress testing

Stress testing is an integral part of our risk management process. It includes both sensitivity and scenario analyses, and is conducted regularly. The ICAAP (a group-wide exercise spanning different risk types) is performed annually.

Stress testing enables us to assess capital adequacy and identify potentially risky portfolio segments as well as inherent systematic risks. This then allows us to develop the right contingency plans, exit strategies and mitigating actions beforehand.

Stress testing alerts senior management to our potential vulnerability to exceptional but plausible adverse events.

Transfer risk limits for priority countries

Risk appetite for each country is approved conducted to assess the impact of changing are set based on country-specific strategic economic conditions on asset quality, earnings performance, capital adequacy and liquidity. DBS' stress testing programme is comprehensive and covers a range of risks and business areas.

A default is considered to have occurred with regard to a particular borrower when either or both of the following events have taken place:

- Subjective default: Borrower is considered to be unlikely to pay its credit obligations in full, without DBS taking action such as realizing security (if held)
- Technical default: Borrower is more than 90 days past due on any credit obligation to DBS

For retail borrowers, the categorization into the respective MAS loan grades is at the facility level and consistent with MAS Notice 612.

## Loans and advances to corporates secured by real estate

These secured loans were extended for the purpose of acquisition and/ or development of real estate, as well as for general working capital. More than 90% of such loans were fully collateralised and majority of these loans had LTV < 80%. Our property loans were mainly concentrated in Singapore and Hong Kong, which together accounted for about 80% of the total property loans.

The LTV ratio is calculated as loans and advances divided by the value of collaterals that secure the same facility. Real estate forms a substantial portion of the collaterals; other collaterals such as cash, marketable securities, and bank guarantees are also included.

6.2 Market risk in 2022

DBS' trading portfolios experienced fourteen backtesting exceptions in 2022, which were mainly driven by a rapid increase in global interest rates that had not been observed for several decades. The main risk factors driving DBS’ trading portfolios in 2022 were interest rates and credit spreads. The following table shows the period-end, average, high and low diversified ES, and ES by risk class for our trading portfolios. Higher ES in 2022 was due to volatile markets caused by various events such as Russia-Ukraine conflict and multiple rate hikes by major central banks.

In 2022, the key market risk drivers of our strategies we employ to manage our liquidity.

7 Liquidity risk

DBS’ liquidity risk arises from our obligations to honour withdrawals of deposits, repayments of borrowed funds at maturity and our commitments to extend loans to our customers. We seek to manage our liquidity to ensure that our liquidity obligations will continue to be honoured under normal as well as adverse circumstances.

### Risk management

Risk methodologies

Risk methodologies

Liquidity risk stress testing is performed regularly using cash flow maturity mismatch analysis, and covers adverse scenarios including general market and idiosyncratic stress scenarios. Stress tests assess our vulnerability when liability run-offs increase, asset rollovers increase and/or liquid asset buffers decrease. In addition, ad hoc stress tests are performed as part of our recovery planning and ICAAP exercises.

The primary measure used to manage liquidity within the tolerance defined by the Board is cash flow maturity mismatch analysis. This form of analysis is performed on a regular basis under normal and adverse scenarios. It assesses the adequacy of our counterbalancing capacity to fund or mitigate any cash flow shortfalls that may occur as forecasted in the cash flow movements across successive time bands.

To ensure that liquidity is managed in line with our Risk Appetite, core parameters such as the types of scenarios, the survival period and the minimum level of liquid assets, are pre-specified for monitoring and control on a group-wide basis. Any occurrences of forecasted shortfalls that cannot be covered by our counterbalancing capacity will be escalated to the relevant committees for evaluation and action.

#### Processes, systems and reports

The diagrams below show our funding structure as at 31 December 2022.

Robust internal control processes and systems support our overall approach in identifying, measuring, aggregating, controlling and monitoring liquidity risk across DBS. Continuous improvement in data and reporting platforms has allowed most elements of internal liquidity risk reporting to be centralized.

|Liabilities and Equity|Assets|
|---|---|
|8%|10%|
|1%|9%|
| |6%|
|Loan/deposit ratio 56%| |
|Total equity 78.7%| |
| |Others|
|Other liabilities 71%| |
| |Loans and advances to customers|
| |Banks and corporate securities|
|Due from banks 10%| |
|Government securities and T-bills 8%| |
|Due to banks 9%| |
|Cash and balances with central banks 7%| |

Refer to Note 31 to the financial statements on page 153 for more details of our wholesale funding sources and Note 44.1 on page 178 for the contractual maturity profile of our assets and liabilities.

#### Wholesale Funding Breakdown (SGD billion)

| |2022|2021|
|---|---|---|
|Customer deposits|91%|92%|
|Wholesale funding|9%|8%|

DBS aims to maintain continuous access to the investor base for capital and senior wholesale funding to support our commercial banking activities. We seek cost efficiencies over the long term and to broaden our investor base through proactive and frequent engagement. Capital instruments are primarily issued from DBS Group Holdings Ltd (DBSH) while covered bonds originate from DBS Bank Ltd. Senior notes are issued from both DBSH and the Bank as required.

#### Liquidity risk in 2022

DBS actively monitors and manages our liquidity profile through cash flow maturity mismatch analysis. In forecasting cash flow under the analysis, behavioral profiling is necessary in cases where a product has indeterminate maturity or the contractual maturity does not realistically reflect the expected cash flow.

| |Less than 1 week|1 week to 1 month|1 to 3 months|3 to 6 months|6 months to 1 year|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|As at 31 Dec 2022|27,278|1,126|-15,986|23,451|10,019|

|Cumulative mismatch|37,477|58,096|51,540|65,164|72,300|

(a) Positive indicates a position of liquidity surplus. Negative indicates a liquidity shortfall that has to be funded

(b) As the behavioral assumptions used to determine the maturity mismatch between assets and liabilities are updated from time to time, the liquidity mismatches may not be directly comparable across past balance sheet dates

7.3 Liquid assets

Liquid assets are assets that are readily available and can be easily monetised to meet obligations and expenses under times of stress.

Such assets are internally defined under the governance of the relevant oversight committees, taking into account the asset class, issuer type and credit rating, among other criteria, before they are reflected as available funds through cash flow maturity mismatch analysis.

DBS’ Treasury function expects to be able to operationally monetise our pool of liquid assets to meet liquidity shortfalls when the need arises. These liquid assets must be unencumbered and free of any legal, regulatory, contractual or other restrictions.

In practice, liquid assets are maintained in key locations and currencies to ensure that operating entities in such locations possess a degree of self-sufficiency to support business needs and guard against contingencies. The main portion of our liquid assets is centrally maintained in Singapore to support liquidity needs in smaller overseas subsidiaries and branches. Internally, DBS sets a requirement to maintain its pool of liquid assets above a minimum level as a source of contingent funds, taking into account regulatory recommended liquid asset levels as well as internally projected stress shortfalls under the cash flow maturity mismatch analysis.

|SGD million|Encumbered|Unencumbered|Total[1]|Average [2]|[1] + [2]|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|As at 31 Dec 2022|9,690|11,761|21,451|20,519|32,719|54,170|

|Banks and corporate securities|23,675|134,990|158,665|155,129| |
|Total| | |96,088|254,753| |

(a) Unencumbered balances with central banks comprise holdings that are unrestricted and available overnight. The encumbered portion represents the mandatory balances held with central banks, which includes a minimum cash balance (MCB) amount that may be available for use under a liquidity stress situation. The “Others" portion includes term placements with central banks

(b) Liquid assets comprise nostro accounts and eligible certificates of deposits

(c) Total liquid assets reflected on an average basis over the four quarters in 2022

(d) “Others" refer to assets that are not recognized as part of the available pool of liquid assets for liquidity management under stress due to (but not limited to) inadequate or non-rated credit quality, operational challenges in monetization (e.g. holdings in physical scrips), and other considerations

### 7.4 Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)

### 7.5 Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)

Under MAS Notice to Banks No. 649 “Minimum Liquid Assets (MLA) and Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)” (MAS Notice 649), DBS, as a Domestic Systemically Important Bank (D-SIB) incorporated and headquartered in Singapore, is required to comply with the LCR standards.

DBS’ LCR is sensitive to balance sheet movements resulting from commercial loan/deposit activities, wholesale inter-bank lending/borrowing, and to the maturity tenor changes of these positions as they fall into or out of the LCR 30-day tenor. In order to meet the LCR requirements, DBS holds a pool of unencumbered High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) comprising predominantly cash, balances with central banks and highly rated bonds issued by governments or supranational entities.

## Reputational Risk

DBS views reputational risk typically as an outcome of any failure to manage risks in our day-to-day activities/decisions, and from changes in the operating environment. These risks include:

- Financial risk (credit, market and liquidity risks)
- Inherent risk (operational and business/strategic risks)

### Reputational risk management at DBS

DBS' approach to reputational risk management comprises the following building blocks:

- Policies
- Risk methodologies
- Processes, systems, and reports

#### Policies

DBS adopts a four-step approach for reputational risk management, which is to prevent, detect, escalate, and respond to reputational risk events.

As reputational risk is typically a consequence of the failure to manage other risk types, the definitions and principles for managing such risks are articulated in the respective risk policies.

#### Risk methodologies

Under the various risk policies, DBS has established mechanisms for ongoing risk monitoring, including risk limits, key risk indicators, and other operating metrics.

#### Processes, systems, and reports

DBS' units are responsible for the day-to-day management of reputational risk and ensure that processes and procedures are in place to identify, assess, and respond to this risk.

### Reputational risk in 2022

DBS' priority is to prevent the occurrence of a reputational risk event by adopting good risk attitudes and behaviors, instead of taking mitigating action when it occurs. There were no significant reputational risk incidents endangering the DBS franchise in 2022.

### Capital management and planning

The table below analyses the movement in Common Equity Tier 1, Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital during the year.

### Capital adequacy ratios

As at 31 December 2022, our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital adequacy ratio (CAR) was 14.6% which was above our target ratio of around 13.0% ± 0.5%. Our CET1 CAR, as well as Tier 1 and Total CARs, comfortably exceeded the minimum CAR requirements under MAS Notice 637, effective from 1 January 2019, of 9.0%, 10.5% and 12.5% respectively (this includes the capital conservation buffer but excludes the countercyclical capital buffer).

As at 31 December 2022, our consolidated leverage ratio stood at 6.4%, well above the 3.0% minimum ratio set by the MAS effective 1 January 2018. Refer to “Five-Year Summary” on page 189 for the historical trend of Tier 1 and Total CAR. Refer to DBS Group’s Pillar 3 disclosures published on DBS website (https://www.dbs.com/investors/default.page) for details on our RWA.

| |2022|2021|
|---|---|---|
|Common Equity Tier 1 capital|50,487|49,248|
|Tier 1 capital|52,880|51,640|

### Capital management and planning

The chart below analyses the drivers of the movement in Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) CAR during the year.

| |Dec 2021|Proft for the year|Dividends paid to Shareholders|Other CET1 movements|Credit RWA|Market RWA|Operational RWA|Dec 2022 CET1|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Group Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) CAR|14.4%|2.4%|-1.1%|-0.9%|0.3%|0.04%|-0.5%|14.6%|

The minimum CAR requirements based on MAS Notice 637 have been fully phased in from 1 January 2019 and are summarised in the table below.

| |From 1 January 2019 and beyond|Minimum CAR %|
|---|---|---|
|Common Equity Tier 1 (a)|6.5| |
|Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB) (b)|2.5| |
|Common Equity Tier 1 including CCB (a) + (b)|9.0| |
|Tier 1 including CCB|10.5| |
|Total including CCB|12.5| |
|Maximum Countercyclical Buffer (1)|2.5| |

Note:

(1) The countercyclical buffer is not an ongoing requirement and is only applied as and when specified by the relevant banking supervisors. The applicable magnitude will be a weighted average of the jurisdiction-specific countercyclical buffer requirements that are required by national authorities in jurisdictions to which a bank has private sector credit exposures. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) expects jurisdictions to implement the countercyclical buffer during periods of excessive credit growth. Of the jurisdictions where we have material private sector credit exposures, Hong Kong has applied a countercyclical buffer of 2.5% from 1 January 2019, reducing to 2.0% from 14 October 2019 and 1.0% from 16 March 2020 and remained unchanged thereafter.

The MAS has designated DBS Bank as a domestic systemically important bank (D-SIB). Under the MAS’ framework for identifying and supervising D-SIBs, the higher loss absorbency requirement for locally incorporated D-SIBs is met by the foregoing minimum ratios being two percentage points higher than those established by the Basel Committee. The Basel Committee has developed an indicator-based methodology for identifying global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) on which higher loss absorbency requirements will be imposed. While we are not a G-SIB, we are required to disclose the set of indicators which are included in the Group’s Pillar 3 disclosures published on DBS website (https://www.dbs.com/investors/default.page).

On 19 December 2022, the MAS announced that the implementation of the final Basel III reforms in Singapore will be deferred to between 1 January 2024 and 1 January 2025. This move is to allow the industry sufficient time for proper implementation of systems needed to adopt the revised framework, and is aligned with the implementation timelines of other major jurisdictions. The MAS will finalize the implementation timeline for the final Basel III reforms (including the transitional arrangement for the output floor) by 1 July 2023.

On 7 February 2022, the MAS imposed on DBS Bank an additional capital requirement arising from the widespread unavailability of DBS Bank’s digital banking services during 23 to 25 November 2021. Notwithstanding the multiplier of 1.5 times applied on DBS Bank’s risk-weighted assets for operational risk, the Group’s capital ratios remained robust. The additional capital requirement will be reviewed when MAS is satisfied that DBS Bank has addressed the shortcomings identified through an independent review of the incident.

With effect from 1 January 2023, MAS Notice 637 was amended to: (a) implement the revised Pillar 3 disclosure requirements for IRRBB published by the Basel Committee; (b) implement a -100bps interest rate floor on the post-shock interest rates under the standardized interest rate shock scenarios set out in Annex 10C of MAS Notice 637; (c) provide additional clarity on the application of interest rate floors, interest rate caps, and pass-through rates when computing IRRBB under the standardized interest rate shock scenarios; and (d) implement various other technical revisions.

### Sustainability

Accelerating our climate agenda

In 2022, we announced one of the most comprehensive and ambitious sets of decarbonisation targets in the global banking industry.

Addressing climate change is one of the greatest challenges today.

Our case for net-zero by 2050

"We have chosen to prioritise climate change as the most immediate issue today given its urgency and how it is interrelated with other environmental and socio-economic concerns."

We see the case for setting net-zero targets as multi-faceted, where decarbonisation is a:

|1. Societal|2. Risk management|3. Business opportunity|
|---|---|---|
|responsibility|imperative| |

Our climate risk management

In 2022, we developed quantitative models for 9 sectors to identify, assess, and quantify transition risks under different scenarios and their potential financial impact to our customers.

In 2022, we also expanded our climate physical risk assessment to cover major residential mortgage portfolios across three of our core markets, namely Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, building on the assessment of property-lending in Hong Kong in the previous year.

### Our approach to setting targets

Grounded in science

To avoid the worst climate impact, we have chosen to align with science-informed decarbonisation glidepaths.

2030 interim targets

Our transition financing approach

To tackle net-zero now and to focus on transition today, instead of a distant point in the future.

Supports our clients' transition journeys, including the strategic GHG emission reductions of high-emitting assets.

To achieve a net-zero future, we support transition activities by:

- Promote a science-informed approach through adoption of industry best practices
- Address potential trade-offs between various environmental, social, and economic/financial matters
- Highlight potential differences in how an economic activity intended as a transitional solution in Asia may differ from more developed markets
- Strengthen credibility through internal capacity building

(1) Our Steel portfolio was slightly above the target set, which we took reference from the Mission Possible Partnership’s Tech Moratorium scenario.

(2) Our Shipping portfolio Alignment Delta was not aligned with Poseidon Principles trajectories, due to the addition of a small group of financed vessels that belong to a business segment with shorter trade routes.

### Independent auditor’s report

DBS Group Holdings Ltd and its Subsidiaries

Independent auditor’s report

To the members of DBS Group Holdings Ltd

Our audit approach

Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements

Overview

Materiality

Group scoping

Key audit matters

Our opinion

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements of DBS Group Holdings Ltd (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) and the balance sheet of the Company are properly drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1967 (the “Act”) and Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (“SFRS(I)s”) so as to give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Company and the financial performance, the consolidated changes in equity and the consolidated cash flows of the Group for the financial year ended on that date.

What we have audited

The financial statements of the Company and the Group comprise:

- the consolidated income statement of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2022;
- the consolidated statement of comprehensive income of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2022;
- the balance sheets of the Group and of the Company as at 31 December 2022;
- the consolidated statement of changes in equity of the Group for the year then ended;
- the consolidated cash flow statement of the Group for the year then ended; and
- the notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with Singapore Standards on Auditing (“SSAs”). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Independence

We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities (“ACRA Code”) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the statements in Singapore, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ACRA Code.

DBS Annual Report 2022

### Independent auditor’s report

How we developed the audit scope

We tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates. The Group’s financial reporting process is dependent on its Information Technology (“IT”) systems. Our audit scope included testing the operating effectiveness of the controls over the integrity of key financial data processed through the IT systems that are relevant to financial reporting.

In establishing the overall Group audit approach, we determined the extent of audit procedures that were needed to be performed across the Group by us or by other PwC network firms, operating under our instruction, who are familiar with the local laws and regulations in each respective territory, (the “component auditors”). Where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the procedures to be able to conclude whether sufficient and appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the financial statements as a whole.

### Key audit matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial year ended 31 December 2022. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

|Key audit matter|How our audit addressed the key audit matter|
|---|---|
|Specific allowances for loans and advances to customers|We assessed the design and evaluated the operating effectiveness of the controls over the specific allowances for loans and advances. These controls included: - oversight of credit risk by the Group Credit Risk Committee;
- timely management review of credit risk;
- the watchlist identification and monitoring process;
- timely identification of impairment events;
- classification of loans and advances in line with MAS 612; and
- the collateral monitoring and valuation processes.
We determined that we could rely on these controls for the purposes of our audit. We inspected a sample of loans and advances to IBG customers to assess whether the classification of the loans and advances was in line with MAS 612 and, where there was evidence of an impairment loss, whether it had been identified in a timely manner. This included, where relevant, how forbearance had been considered. Where impairment had been identified, for a sample of loans and advances, our work included: - considering the latest developments in relation to the borrower;
- examining the forecasts of future cash flows prepared by management, including key assumptions in relation to the amount and timing of recoveries;
- comparing the collateral valuation and other sources of repayment to check the calculation of the impairment against external evidence, where available, including independent valuation reports;
- challenging management’s assumptions; and
- testing the calculations.
For a sample of performing loans and advances to IBG customers which had not been identified by management as potentially impaired, we evaluated management’s assumptions on their classification, using external evidence where available in respect of the relevant borrower. Based on procedures performed, we have assessed that the aggregate specific allowance for loans and advances is appropriate.|

(Refer also to Notes 3 and 19 to the financial statements.)

## Independent auditor’s report

|Key audit matter|Valuation of financial instruments held at fair value|
|---|---|
| |Financial instruments held by the Group at fair value include derivative assets and liabilities, trading securities, certain debt instruments and other assets and liabilities designated at fair value.|
| |The Group’s financial instruments are predominantly valued using quoted market prices (‘Level 1’) or market observable prices (‘Level 2’). The valuations of ‘Level 3’ instruments rely on significant unobservable inputs.|
| |We considered the overall valuation of financial instruments (Level 1, 2 and 3) to be a key audit matter given the financial significance to the Group, the nature of the underlying products and the estimation involved to determine fair value.|
| |In determining fair value, management also make adjustments to recognize credit risk, funding costs, bid-offer spreads and, in some cases, parameter and model risk limitations. This is broadly consistent with the banking industry, albeit the methodology to calculate some of these adjustments is continuing to evolve.|
| |(Refer also to Notes 3 and 42 to the financial statements.)|

## Other Information

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Directors’ Statement (but does not include the statements and our auditor’s report thereon), which we obtained prior to the date of this auditor’s report, and the other sections of the Annual Report (“the Other Sections”) which are expected to be made available to us after that date.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor’s report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

When we read the Other Sections, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance and take appropriate actions in accordance with SSAs.

## Responsibilities of Management and Directors for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the provisions of the Act and SFRS(I)s, and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition; and transactions are properly authorized and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair financial statements and to maintain accountability of assets.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The directors’ responsibilities include overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.

## Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements

In our opinion, the accounting and other records required by the Act to be kept by the Company and by those subsidiary corporations incorporated in Singapore of which we are the auditors, have been properly kept in accordance with the provisions of the Act.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Yura Mahindroo.

From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

Overall, we considered that the valuation of financial instruments held at fair value was within a reasonable range of outcomes.

### Income Statement

Income recognition

Interest income and interest expense

Interest is accrued on all interest-bearing financial assets and financial liabilities, regardless of their classification and measurement, except for limited transactions measured at FVPL where the economics are better reflected in “Net trading income”.

Interest income and interest expense are recognized on a time-proportionate basis using the effective interest method. The calculation includes significant fees and transaction costs that are integral to the effective interest rate, as well as premiums or discounts.

Fee and commission income

The Group earns fee and commission income from a diverse range of products and services provided to its customers. Fee and commission income are recognized when the Group has satisfied its performance obligation in providing the promised products and services to the customer.

### Balance Sheet

Financial assets

Initial recognition

Purchases and sales of all financial assets are recognized on the date that the Group enters into the contractual arrangements with counterparties.

Derivatives (including derivatives embedded in financial liabilities but separated for accounting purposes) are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as hedging instruments.

### Cash and cash equivalents

For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and non-restricted balances with central banks which are readily convertible into cash.

### Impairment of financial assets at amortised cost and FVOCI

Expected Credit Losses (ECL)

ECL are recognized for all financial assets held at amortised cost, debt instruments measured at FVOCI, guarantees, and undrawn credit commitments. It represents the present value of expected cash shortfalls over the residual term of a financial asset, guarantee, or undrawn commitment.

### Income Statement

Dividend income

Dividend income is recognized when the right to receive payment is established. This is generally the ex-dividend date for listed equity securities, and the date when shareholders approve the dividend for unlisted equity securities.

Dividend income arising from financial assets classified as FVPL is recognized in “Net trading income”, while those arising from FVOCI financial assets are recognized in “Net income from investment securities”.

### Allowances for credit and other losses

Please refer to Note 2.11 for the accounting policy on impairment of financial assets.

Stage 3 - Financial instruments that become credit-impaired with evidence of default, i.e. non-performing assets, are transferred to Stage 3. Please refer to Risk Management section for the definition of non-performing assets. Expected default frequency is in turn a market-based point-in-time default risk measure driven by the market value of firms' assets, asset volatility and leverage. CCIs are then used as inputs to convert the generally more through-the-cycle PDs derived from Basel models/parameters into the point-in-time equivalents by adding the unaccounted portion of cyclical variations, as well as to incorporate forward-looking information. LGDs are determined using historical loss data, which are adjusted for both the latest and forecasted recovery experience.

The Group relies on a Monte Carlo simulation approach to consider over 100 probability-weighted forward-looking scenarios in estimating ECL. This involves simulations of many alternative CCI scenarios to arrive at an unbiased ECL estimate that are meant to cover all possible good and bad scenarios based on known estimates. For retail portfolios, historical loss experience is used in conjunction with the forecast loss rates which take into account relevant macroeconomic variables, such as property prices and unemployment rates.

Expert credit judgement and post model adjustments. The measurement of ECL requires the application of expert credit judgement and post model adjustments. These include: assignment of credit risk ratings and determination of whether exposures should be placed on credit watchlists; assessment of whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred; selecting and calibrating the ECL models such as CCIs; determining the expected remaining maturity of revolving products (e.g. overdrafts and credit cards); determination of the forecast loss rates; and application of thematic overlays based on emerging risk themes where potential risks may not be fully captured in the underlying modelled ECL.

Singapore banks are required to maintain the Minimum Regulatory Loss Allowances (MRLA) of at least 1% of the gross carrying amount of selected credit exposures net of collaterals per MAS Notice 612. For periods when Stage 1 and 2 ECL fall below MRLA, the shortfall is appropriated from retained earnings in the shareholders' funds into a non-distributable Regulatory Loss Allowance Reserve (RLAR) account.

### Properties and other fixed assets

Owned properties and other fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to write down the costs of the assets to their estimated residual values over the estimated useful lives of the assets. No depreciation is recognized when the residual value is higher than the carrying amount.

Generally, the useful lives are as follows:

|Leasehold land|100 years or over the remaining lease period, whichever is shorter. Leasehold land where the unexpired lease period is more than 100 years is not depreciated.|
|---|---|
|Buildings|30 to 50 years or over the remaining lease period, whichever is shorter.|
|Computer software|3 to 5 years|
|Office equipment, furniture and fittings|5 to 10 years|
|Leasehold improvements|Up to 20 years|

Leased properties and other fixed assets.

### Financial liabilities

Initial recognition, classification and subsequent measurement. Financial liabilities are initially recognized at fair value. The Group generally classifies and measures its financial liabilities in accordance with the purpose for which the financial liabilities are incurred and managed. Accordingly:

Financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss if they are incurred for the purpose

---
## A Different Kind of Bank DBS Annual Report 2022

Financial statements
135

Realised or unrealised gains or losses on financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated under the fair value option, except interest expense, are taken to “Net trading income” in the income statement in the period they arise. The changes to the fair value of financial liabilities designated under the fair value option that are attributable to a reporting entity’s own credit risk are taken to revenue reserves through other comprehensive income. These amounts are not transferred to the income statement even when realised.

Derivative liabilities are treated consistently with derivative assets. Please refer to Note 2.9 for the accounting policy on derivatives.

Other financial liabilities are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. These comprise predominantly the Group’s “Deposits and balances from customers”, “Due to banks” and “Other debt securities”.

Where the classification and measurement of financial liabilities do not reflect the management of the financial liabilities, the Group may apply hedge accounting where permissible and relevant to better reflect the management of the financial liabilities. Please refer to Note 2.19 for details on hedging and hedge accounting.

Ordinary shares, preference shares and other instruments which do not result in the Group having a contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset, or to exchange financial liabilities with the holder under conditions that are potentially unfavorable to the Group, are classified as equity. Distributions arising from such instruments are recognized in equity as there is no contractual obligation to pay distributions on these instruments. Incremental external costs directly attributable to the issuance of such instruments are accounted for as a deduction from equity.

When any entity within the Group purchases the Company’s ordinary shares (“treasury shares”), the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental cost is presented as a component within equity, until they are cancelled, sold or reissued.

When treasury shares are subsequently cancelled, the cost of the treasury shares is deducted against either the share capital account or retained earnings. When treasury shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any realized gain or loss on sale or reissue, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and related income tax, is recognized in other reserves.

For ordinary and preference shares, interim dividends are recorded during the financial year in which they are declared payable. Final dividends are recorded during the financial year in which the dividends are approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.

### Loan commitments, letters of credit and financial guarantees

Loan commitments are not recognized on the balance sheet and are disclosed in Note 36. Upon a loan draw-down, the amount of the loan is generally recognized as “Loans and advances to customers” on the Group’s balance sheet.

Letters of credit are recorded off-balance sheet as contingent liabilities upon issuance, and the corresponding payables to the beneficiaries and of repurchasing in the near term (“held for trading”), and this receivables from the applicants are recognized on the balance sheet upon acceptance of the underlying documents.

### Other Specific Topics

2.19 Hedging and hedge accounting

As part of the overall risk management of the Group, derivatives and other financial instruments are used to manage exposures to interest rate and foreign currency risks, including exposures arising from forecast transactions.

2.20 Employee benefits

Employee benefits, which include base pay, cash bonuses, share-based compensation, contribution to defined contribution plans such as the Central Provident Fund and other staff-related allowances, are recognized in the income statement when incurred.

2.21 Share-based compensation

Employee benefits also include share-based compensation, namely the DBSH Share Plan, the DBSH Employee Share Plan, and the DBSH Employee Share Purchase Plan (the Plans). The details of the Plans are described in Note 40.

Financial assets and liabilities are presented net when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts, and there is intention to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Financial assets and liabilities subject to netting agreements but not offset on the balance sheet

The Group enters into master netting arrangements with counterparties where it is appropriate and feasible to do so to mitigate counterparty risk. The credit risk associated with favourable contracts is reduced by a master netting arrangement to the extent that if an event of default occurs, all amounts with the counterparty are settled on a net basis. Master netting arrangements do not result in an offset of financial assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, as the legal right to offset the transactions is conditional upon default.

These agreements include derivative master agreements (including the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Master Agreement), global master repurchase agreements and global securities lending agreements. The collaterals received and pledged under these agreements are generally conducted under terms that are in accordance with normal market practice. The agreements may allow rehypothecation of collateral received and there may be ongoing margin requirements to mitigate counterparty risk.

19. Loans and Advances to Customers
20. Financial Assets Pledged or Transferred

The Group pledges or transfers financial assets to third parties in the ordinary course of business. Transferred assets continue to be recognised in the Group’s financial statements when the Group retains substantially all their risks and rewards. Among these, as set out below, are securities pledged or transferred pursuant to repurchase or securities lending or collateral swap agreements and for derivative transactions under credit support agreements.

|Net total|414,519|408,993|

Securities transferred under repurchase, securities lending and collateral swap arrangements are generally conducted under terms in line with normal market practice. The counterparty is typically allowed to sell or re-pledge the securities but has an obligation to return them at maturity. If the securities decrease in value, the Group may, in certain circumstances, be required to place additional collateral.

For repurchase agreements, the securities pledged or transferred continue to be recorded on the balance sheet while cash received in exchange is recorded as a financial liability. The Group also pledges assets to secure its short position in securities and to facilitate settlement operations. The fair value of the associated liabilities approximates their carrying amount of $9,020 million (2021: $4,488 million), which are recorded under "Debt to banks", "Deposits and balances from customers" and "Other liabilities" on the balance sheet.

For securities lending and collateral swap transactions, the securities lent continue to be recorded on the balance sheet. As the Group mainly receives other financial assets in exchange, the associated liabilities are not recorded on the balance sheet.

In addition, the Group also pledges securities for derivative transactions under credit support agreements. These assets continue to be recorded on the balance sheet. As the related derivative assets and liabilities are managed on a portfolio basis, there is no direct relationship between the securities pledged and the associated liabilities. As such, the associated liabilities are not disclosed.

Refer to Note 43.4 for a breakdown of loans and advances to customers by geography and by industry.

Covered bonds: Pursuant to the Bank’s Global Covered Bond Programme, selected pools of residential mortgages originated by the Bank have been assigned to a bankruptcy-remote structured entity, Bayfront Covered Bonds Pte Ltd. These residential mortgages continue to be recognised on the Bank’s balance sheet as the Bank remains exposed to the risks and rewards associated with them. As at 31 December 2022, the carrying value of the covered bonds in issue was $7,575 million (2021: $5,689 million), while the carrying value of assets assigned was $16,740 million (2021: $9,237 million). The difference in values is attributable to an intended over-collateralisation required to maintain the credit ratings of the covered bonds in issue, and additional assets assigned to facilitate future issuances.

## Financial Derivatives

### Trading derivatives

Most of the Group’s derivatives relate to sales and trading activities. Sales activities include the structuring and marketing of derivatives to customers to enable them to take, transfer, modify or reduce current or expected risks. Trading activities are entered into principally for dealer’s margin or for the purpose of generating a profit from short-term fluctuations in price.

### Hedging derivatives

The accounting treatment of hedging derivatives varies according to the nature of the hedge and whether the hedge meets the specified criteria to qualify for hedge accounting. Derivatives transacted for economic hedges but do not qualify for hedge accounting are treated in the same way as derivative instruments held for trading purposes. Please refer to Note 39 for more details on derivatives used for hedging.

As at 31 December 2022, changes required to systems, processes and exposures impacted by IBOR reform have been identified and have been substantially implemented.

Interest Rate Benchmark Reform

In March 2021, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced the dates on which LIBOR would be discontinued. All GBP, CHF, EUR, JPY London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) settings and the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR settings would lose representativeness or discontinue after 31 December 2021. The remaining USD LIBOR settings would lose representativeness or discontinue after 30 June 2023. In Singapore, as announced by the Steering Committee for SOR & SIBOR Transition to SORA (SC-STS) on 31 March 2021, Singapore Swap Offer Rate (SOR), which relies on USD LIBOR in its computation, would similarly be discontinued immediately after 30 June 2023 across all settings. The Singapore Interbank Offered Rate (SIBOR) would discontinue by end-2024, with 6-month SIBOR being discontinued immediately after 31 March 2022.

The Group’s main interest rate benchmark exposures are USD LIBOR, SOR, and SIBOR. USD LIBOR will be replaced by USD Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) while the replacement benchmark rate for SOR and SIBOR is Singapore Overnight Rate Average (SORA).

During the year, the Group continued to apply the practical expedients provided in SFRS(I) 9. These expedients require changes in the contractual cash flows of financial instruments that result solely from IBOR reform and are economically equivalent to be accounted for by updating the effective interest rate, rather than recognizing an immediate gain or loss in the income statement.

Hedge accounting

During the year, the Group continued to apply SFRS (I) 9’s hedge accounting reliefs relating to Interest Rate Benchmark Reform. The key assumption made when performing hedge accounting is that both the hedged item and hedging instrument will be amended from existing IBORs to new Alternative Reference Rates (ARRs) at the same time. Where actual differences between those dates arise, hedge ineffectiveness will be recorded in the income statement.

How the Group is managing the transition to ARRs

A Group steering committee was established in 2019 to manage the impact of IBOR reform on the Group. The committee comprises senior representatives from Institutional Banking Group, Consumer Banking Group, Treasury Markets, Finance, Risk Management Group, Technology & Operations, Legal and Compliance and Group Strategic Marketing and Communications and is chaired by the Corporate Treasurer. The Terms of Reference of the committee are to review transition plans related to LIBOR and SOR discontinuation, SIBOR reform and other interest rate benchmark reform, to assess the Group’s key risks across different scenarios, and to develop strategies to manage existing and new business in the context of these risks. Oversight of IBOR reform is provided by the Group Executive Committee and the Board Risk Management Committee.

The Group typically uses foreign currency denominated borrowings/deposits to fund its investments in non-SGD denominated FVOCI equity instruments. To reduce the accounting mismatch on the borrowings/deposits and FVOCI equity instruments because of foreign exchange rate movements, the Group designates the borrowings/deposits as the hedging instruments in fair value hedges of the FVOCI equity instruments. The hedge ratio is determined by comparing the principal of the borrowings/deposits with the investment costs of the FVOCI equity instruments.

A potential source of ineffectiveness is a decrease in the fair value of the equity instruments below their investment costs. The Group is predominantly exposed to variability in future cash flows due to interest rate movements and foreign currency fluctuations from the following:

- assets subject to repricing, reinvestment or refinancing risk;
- forecasted interest earnings denominated in foreign currency;
- issued floating or fixed rate foreign currency debt; and
- floating or fixed rate foreign currency bonds.

In accordance with the Group risk management strategy, the Group enters into interest rate swaps, foreign currency forwards and swaps, as well as cross currency swaps to protect against the variability of cash flows due to changes in interest rates and/or foreign currency exchange rates.

(a) The carrying amounts of debt and equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income do not include fair value hedge adjustments as the hedged assets are measured at fair value. The accounting for the hedge relationship results in a transfer from other comprehensive income to the income statement for debt instruments

For the year ended 31 December 2022, the net gains on hedging instruments used to calculate hedge effectiveness was $121 million (2021: net gains of $167 million). The net losses on hedged items attributable to the hedged risk amounted to $118 million (2021: net losses of $166 million).

## Financial statements

39.3 Net investment hedges

The Group manages currency risk of its net investment in foreign operations (or structural foreign exchange risk) using foreign currency borrowings, foreign currency forwards and swaps, as well as cross currency swaps. As part of the Group’s remuneration policy, the Group provides various share-based compensation plans to foster a culture that aligns employees’ interests with shareholders’, enable employees to share in the Group’s performance and enhance talent retention.

Structural foreign exchange exposures are managed with the primary aim of ensuring that consolidated capital ratios are largely protected from the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates against SGD.

Under the Group’s hedging strategy, the carrying amount of these investments could be fully hedged, partially hedged or not hedged at all. The Group regularly reviews its hedging strategy, taking into account the long-term outlook of currency fundamentals and the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on capital adequacy ratios.

|Main Scheme/ Plan|Note|
|---|---|
|DBSH Share Plan (Share Plan)|40.1|

The Share Plan is granted to Group executives as determined by the committee appointed to administer the Share Plan (“Committee”) from time to time. Participants are awarded shares of the Company or, at the Committee’s discretion, their equivalent cash value or a combination. Awards consist of main award and retention award (20%/ 15% of main award) for employees on bonus/ sales incentive plans respectively. Dividends on unvested shares do not accrue to employees.

For employees on bonus plan, the main award vests from 2 to 4 years after grant i.e. 33% will vest 2 years after grant; another 33% will vest on the third year and the remaining 34% plus the retention award will vest 4 years after grant.

For employees on sales incentive plan, the main award vests from 1 to 3 years after grant; i.e. 33% will vest 1 year after grant, another 33% will vest on the second year and the remaining 34% plus the retention award will vest 3 years after grant.

Top performers and key employees are also awarded shares as part of talent retention. There are no additional retention awards for such shares granted. The shares are subject to the usual four-year vesting schedule.

The awards will lapse immediately upon termination of employment, except in the event of ill health, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement or death.

The market price of shares on the grant date is used to estimate the fair value of the shares awarded. The fair value of the shares granted includes an adjustment to exclude the present value of future expected dividends to be paid during the vesting period.

Vested and unvested shares are subject to clawback/ malus. Conditions that trigger such clawback/ malus are in the Remuneration Report section of the Annual Report.

Shares are awarded to non-executive Directors as part of director’s remuneration. Details of these awards are disclosed in the Corporate Governance section of the Annual Report.

The Directors reviewed the changes to the vesting schedule and retention award percentage on 5 December 2022. This includes a revision to the share and cash deferral proportions for Senior Management and Material Risk Personnel to be in line with regulatory and market practices. The changes will apply to the shares grant in 2023 and do not impact the 2022 financial statements.

(a) Refers to net tangible assets of entities (e.g. subsidiaries, associates, joint ventures and overseas branches) or units with non-SGD functional currency

(b) Includes the Treasury Markets trading business in Singapore (“TM Singapore”). With effect from 1 January 2021, the functional currency of TM Singapore changed from SGD to US dollars (USD) to better reflect the increasing dominance of the USD in the business activities of TM Singapore

|DBSH Employee Share Plan (ESP)|40.1|
|---|---|
|The Committee has ceased granting shares under the ESP effective from financial year 2018 remuneration. All outstanding ESP share grants have fully vested in 2022.| |

|DBSH Employee Share Purchase Plan (ESPP)|40.2|
|---|---|
|The ESPP was implemented in 2019 in selective markets across the Group. All permanent employees who hold the rank of Vice President and below are eligible to participate in the scheme.| |
|The ESPP is a share ownership plan for eligible employees to own DBSH shares through monthly contributions via deductions from payroll or designated bank accounts.| |
|Participants contribute up to 10% of month salary (minimum S$50, capped at S$1,000) and the Group will match 25% of the participant’s contributions to buy DBSH ordinary shares for a period of 12 months during each plan year.| |
|The matching shares bought from the Group’s contribution will vest 24 months after the last contribution month for each plan year.| |
|The matching shares will lapse immediately upon termination of employment, except in the event of ill health, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement or death.| |

### Loans and advances to customers

Certain loans and advances to customers, contingent liabilities and commitments are typically collateralised to a substantial extent. In particular, residential mortgage exposures are generally fully secured by residential properties. Income-producing real estate, which is a sub-set of the Specialised Lending exposure, is fully secured by the underlying assets financed.

The extent to which credit exposures are covered by Basel eligible collateral, besides real estate, after the application of the requisite regulatory haircuts, is shown in the Group’s Pillar 3 Disclosures (unaudited). The amounts are a sub-set of the actual collateral arrangements entered by the Group as Basel imposes strict legal and operational standards before collateral can be admitted as credit risk mitigants. As a result, certain collateral arrangements which do not meet its criteria will not be included. Certain collateral types which are not permitted as credit risk mitigants for credit exposures under the Standardised Approach are also excluded.

### Analysis of Collateral

Balances with central banks, Government securities and treasury bills, Due from banks and Bank and corporate debt securities - Collateral is generally not sought for these assets.

Derivatives - The Group maintains collateral agreements and enters into master netting agreements with most of the counterparties for derivative transactions. Please refer to Note 37 for the impact of netting arrangements recognised for the computation of Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR).

44. Capital Management

The Board is responsible for setting the Group’s capital management objective, which is to maintain a strong capital position consistent with regulatory requirements under the MAS Notice to Banks No. 637 “Notice on Risk Based Capital Adequacy Requirements for Banks Incorporated in Singapore” (MAS Notice 637) and MAS Notice FHC-N637, and the expectations of various stakeholders, including customers, investors and rating agencies. The Board articulates this objective in the form of capital targets. This objective is pursued while delivering returns to shareholders and ensuring that adequate capital resources are available for business growth and investment opportunities as well as adverse situations, taking into consideration the Group’s strategic plans and risk appetite.

The Group’s capital management objective is implemented via a capital management and planning process that is overseen by the Capital Committee. The Chief Financial Officer chairs the Capital Committee. The Capital Committee receives regular updates on the Group’s current and projected capital positions. A key tool for capital planning is the annual Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) through which the Group assesses its forecast capital supply and demand relative to regulatory requirements and internal capital targets. The ICAAP generally has a three-year horizon and covers various scenarios, including stress scenarios of differing scope and severity.

The Group is subject to and has complied with the capital adequacy requirements set out in the MAS Notice FHC-N637, which effects the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s capital adequacy framework in Singapore, throughout the year. The Group’s capital adequacy ratios as at 31 December 2022 and 2021 have been subject to an external limited assurance review, pursuant to the MAS Notice FHC-N609 “Auditor’s Report and Additional Information to be submitted with Annual Accounts”.

For more information, please refer to the Group’s Pillar 3 disclosures (unaudited) published on DBS website (https://www.dbs.com/investors/default.page).

(a) Derivative financial assets and liabilities are included in the “Less than 7 days” bucket as they are mainly held for trading. Please refer to the tables in Note 39 for the maturity profile of hedging derivatives

The above table includes disclosure of the contractual maturity of financial liabilities, which approximates the same analysis on an undiscounted basis, as total future interest payments are not material relative to the principal amounts. Assets and liabilities (including non-maturing savings/current deposits) are represented on a contractual basis or in a period when it can legally be withdrawn. The cash flows of assets and liabilities may behave differently from their contractual terms.

Notice of Annual General Meeting

Personal data privacy: 31 December 2022 (“FY2022”). If approved, each of the non-executive Directors (with the exception of Mr Chng Kai Fong) will receive 70% of his or her Directors’ fees in cash and 30% of his or her Directors’ fees in the form of share awards granted pursuant to the DBSH Share Plan. The share awards will not be subject to a vesting period, but will be subject to a selling moratorium whereby each non-executive Director will be required to hold the equivalent of one year’s basic retainer for the duration of his or her tenure as a Director, and for one year after the date he or she steps down as a Director. The actual number of shares to be awarded will be determined by reference to the volume-weighted average price of a share on the SGX-ST over the 10 trading days immediately prior to (and excluding) the date of the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, rounded down to the nearest share, and any residual balance will be paid in cash. The Director’s fees for Mr Chng Kai Fong will be paid in cash to a government agency, the Directorship & Consultancy Appointments Council.

Special Business

Ordinary Resolution 8:

DBSH Share Plan

Resolution 8 is to empower the Directors to offer and grant awards and to allot and issue ordinary shares of the Company pursuant to the DBSH Share Plan, provided that (a) the maximum number of ordinary shares which may be issued under the DBSH Share Plan (including the California sub-plan to the DBSH Share Plan) is limited to 5% of the total number of issued shares of the Company (excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings) from time to time; and (b) the aggregate number of new ordinary shares under awards which may be granted pursuant to the DBSH Share Plan (including the California sub-plan to the DBSH Share Plan) from this Annual General Meeting to the next Annual General Meeting shall not exceed 1% of the total number of issued shares of the Company (excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings) from time to time.

For the purpose of determining the aggregate number of shares that may be issued, the percentage of issued shares shall be based on the total number of issued shares of the Company at the time that Resolution 10 is passed, after adjusting for (a) new shares arising from the conversion or exercise of any convertible securities or share options or vesting of share awards which were issued and are outstanding or subsisting at the time that Resolution 10 is passed; and (b) any subsequent bonus issue, consolidation or subdivision of shares. As at 10 February 2023 (the “Latest Practicable Date”), the Company had 13,988,809 treasury shares and no subsidiary holdings.

Ordinary Resolution 9:

California Sub-Plan to DBSH Share Plan

Resolution 9 is to empower the Directors to offer and grant awards and to allot and issue ordinary shares of the Company pursuant to the DBSH Share Plan to participants who are residents of the state of California in the United States of America, subject to the terms of the California sub-plan (the “California Sub-Plan”) to the DBSH Share Plan, provided that (a) the maximum aggregate number of ordinary shares which may be issued under the California Sub-Plan is limited to 1,000,000 ordinary shares, subject to any lower limitations required under the DBSH Share Plan; (b) the California Sub-Plan will terminate on, and no further awards will be granted under the California Sub-Plan after, the tenth anniversary of its approval by the Board of Directors of the Company on 15 February 2019; and (c) the awards granted under the California Sub-Plan will be subject to adjustment upon certain changes in the capitalization of the Company. In addition, the California Sub-Plan imposes additional restrictions on participants residing in California other than those contemplated under the DBSH Share Plan.

Ordinary Resolution 10:

Share Issue Mandate

Resolution 10 is to empower the Directors to issue shares of the Company and to make or grant instruments (such as warrants or debentures) convertible into shares, and to issue shares in pursuance of such instruments, up to a number not exceeding in total 50% of the total number of issued shares (excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings) of the Company, of which the number of shares that may be issued other than on a pro rata basis to shareholders must not exceed 10% of the total number of issued shares (excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings).

Based on the existing issued and paid-up Ordinary Shares as at the Latest Practicable Date and excluding any Ordinary Shares held in treasury, the purchase by the Company of 2% of its issued Ordinary Shares will result in the purchase or acquisition of 51,472,576 Ordinary Shares.

Assuming that the Company purchases or acquires 51,472,576 Ordinary Shares at the Maximum Price, in the case of both market and off-market purchases, of SGD 37.68 for one Ordinary Share (being the price equivalent to 5% above the average closing prices of the Ordinary Shares traded on the SGX-ST over the last five market days on which transactions were recorded immediately preceding the Latest Practicable Date), the maximum amount of funds required is approximately SGD 1.9 billion.

Ordinary Resolution 11:

DBSH Scrip Dividend Scheme

Resolution 11 is to empower the Directors, should they choose to apply the DBSH Scrip Dividend Scheme (the “Scheme”) to a qualifying dividend, to issue such number of new ordinary shares of the Company as may be required to be issued pursuant to the Scheme to members who, in respect of a qualifying dividend, have elected to receive scrip in lieu of the cash amount of that qualifying dividend. If the Directors should decide to apply the Scheme to a qualifying dividend, the current intention is that no discount will be given for the scrip shares.

Ordinary Resolution 12:

Renewal of the Share Purchase Mandate

Resolution 12 is to renew the mandate to allow the Company to purchase or otherwise acquire its issued ordinary shares, on the terms and subject to the conditions set out in the Resolution.

The Company may use its internal or external sources of funds or a combination of both to finance its purchase or acquisition of the ordinary shares of the Company (“Ordinary Shares”). The amount of financing required for the Company to purchase or acquire

the Company pursuant to the proposed Share Purchase Mandate on the financial statements of the Group and the Company for the financial year ended 31 December 2022 based on these and other assumptions are set out in paragraph 2.7 of the Letter to Shareholders dated 9 March 2023 (the “Letter”).
